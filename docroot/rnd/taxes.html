<p><em>2021-05-17 - 02445</em><br />Huge traffic jam with one lane JPBikes kills riders and interfere with the flow of traffic. Boston mayor Walsh ruined our neighbors namely JP and Southie abut JP has connecting roads that have created huge issues for drivers . Bike riders don't pay <strong>taxes</strong> for roads, many without helmets. They run lights and don't abide by laws of the road YET get to dictate traffic patterns? I pay 13g in property <strong>taxes</strong> in JP been here since 63. Why? Let's figure this out. Disgusted</p>
<p><em>2021-05-17 - 02127</em><br />What's invalid? Dog shit is still there. It's on a public sidewalk. Public works has the vehicles that wash the sidewalk. So what's invalid? Oh because I pay <strong>taxes</strong>?</p>

<p><em>2021-05-27 - 02127</em><br />Dogs off leash are a City of Boston issue. Correct the problem. This is a problem that occurs every day and the city does nothing about it. If you won't do anything about it, at least tell us why. We don't pay tax to have the grass dug up and shit upon by dogs and I definitely don't pay  <strong>taxes</strong> so the city can pay lawsuit awards for children who are attacked and scarred up by these dogs. FIX THE PROBLEM!</p>

<p><em>2021-04-16 - 02125</em><br />Car with New York plates illegally parked on the street, Resident parking required 7 AM to 7 PM Monday through Friday, the car was parked here yesterday as well. People don't take this seriously and it is unfair that cars from out of state plates continue to simply park here while others pay so much in <strong>taxes</strong> and insurance to live and house their car in the city. Why do other Boston neighborhoods have more consistent monitoring? Multiple times per day. Please monitor and ticket</p>
<p><em>2021-04-22 - 02129</em><br />Dump truck no resident sticker, expired permit from the city parked in the same spot since October, never ticketed it's been reported several times to no avail where is our tax money going? I live on the street and pay outrageous <strong>taxes</strong> to live here and can't find a parking spot because all these illegally parked work trucks are taking resident spots, I submitted this two days ago and four minutes ago it was closed with a message to resubmit if it's still there! Well here's my resubmission!!</p>

I honestly am in contact with my local reps about this and I'm going to make this a thing. We need accountability.

<p><em>2021-04-26 - 02128</em><br />This NH car needs to register with the city & state. If I pay my excise tax and other state <strong>taxes</strong>, they should do. if not, please ticket them because there is a 2 hour limit.</p>

<p><em>2021-05-02 - 02130</em><br />We recently adopted a rambunctious young male Boxer and met another couple with a female Boxer the same age. We have on occasion let the two  run off some steam in the fenced in basketball court at the playground. We've just used the court in the early morning when it is empty. We were approached by animal control today telling us we can't be in the court with dogs. There is no dog run area in our neighborhood. This policy is unfair, we pay property <strong>taxes</strong> just like everyone else</p>
<p><em>2021-05-02 - 02130</em><br />Before you and your significant other separate both of your shoulders patting yourselves on the back for doing a good deed adopting a rescue dog, maybe you should've researched whether it was feasible to have a dog in your neighborhood (i.e. lack of a dog run park). Recent transplants to the city such as yourselves with entitled attitudes just because y'all pay <strong>taxes</strong>/property <strong>taxes</strong> won't win you any fans. And no off leash dogs in city parks either, even if it's "empty".</p>
<p><em>2021-05-03 - 02130</em><br />This Pontiac has been parked all morning despite street sweeping (which sadly hasn't happened). The city is in bad shape. I wonder why we even pay <strong>taxes</strong>.</p>

They steal the dirt bikes, don't pay <strong>taxes</strong> or registration fees- meanwhile you charge us for our cars. WTF?!?!?!?!? This gang of low life losers almost ran me over the other night (have photo to prove it). This is the smartest city in the world. Do something about it. You're liable. If I get hit by one of them while walking across the street, I'm suing you</p>

<p><em>2020-11-07 - 02215</em><br />There are 50+ children screaming outside, not wearing masks and socially gathering. The entire state is following a curfew. These privileged college kids could use a few hundred dollar fines to get the message that they are jeopardize the health, safety and economy of the city that the are just temporary allowed to stay. They don't pay <strong>taxes</strong>. Or high rent! C'mon now. That's $300 fine per student. Sounds like a great enterprise for the city. Oh, and they are loud as hell.</p>
<p><em>2020-11-08 - 02119</em><br />Because they don't pay <strong>taxes</strong> so it's ok.</p>
<p><em>2020-11-09 - 02132</em><br />There is no sidewalk at the bottom of LaGrange and center st in West Roxbury. There are apartments being built but it is no reason why the entire sidewalk is taken up. I don?t pay <strong>taxes</strong> for builders to close the sidewalk at their will and place a random sign up. This needs to be addressed ASAP. |</p>
<p><em>2020-11-09 - 02127</em><br />This car has been parked here for more than a week.  It was ticketed on street cleaning but not towed.  Enough with being nice.  We pay <strong>taxes</strong> and have to go through hell to find parking when these idiots get away with this</p>
<p><em>2020-11-12 - 02138</em><br />I live in Brighton and I have a parking permit and I pay my <strong>taxes</strong> on my car and yet I still cant find parking a bunch of cars parked illegally or dont have permits. Im an essential employee and I can never find parking when I come home late at night especially when theres work being done on other streets. Fix this! Its ridiculous whats the point of me having a permit as well as paying excise <strong>taxes</strong> when I cant even park near my apartment.</p>
<p><em>2020-11-14 - 02127</em><br />Loud party every weekend  called Boston police and party line. Why are we paying <strong>taxes</strong> to stay up all night listening to assholes</p>
<p><em>2020-11-26 - 02201</em><br />Will property <strong>taxes</strong> be going down this year since the city is awash in revenue to be creating new bike lanes that no one uses and only increase traffic?</p>

We need this addressed ASAP. No one in this neighborhood was asked if they wanted trays to be dumped on their street</p>
<p><em>2020-12-03 - 02127</em><br />How about instead of giving a sarcastic response, you actually perform the inspections that have been requested? Or make sure that the safety of the public is adhered to instead of lining the pockets of all involved with this project! Why are they still able to take away spots for construction yet still impede into the travel lanes? Instead of telling me what I should do, why don't you do your job? But you'll fine a home owner that pays City of Boston <strong>taxes</strong> for not hiring a detail. Noted. I know</p>
<p><em>2020-12-04 - 02111</em><br />Homeless person threatening restaurant workers and kicking glass door. Don't give me some bullsh!t response about calling 911. We pay <strong>taxes</strong> and this Chinatown gate park doesn't have enough attention and services.</p>
<p><em>2020-12-16 - 01210</em><br />Please Plow the road.  My mother is 91 years old, has lived at this address for 61 years and has paid <strong>taxes</strong> for all of those years.  Some years the road gets plowed and some years it does not.  Some storms it gets plowed and some storms it does not.  I have asked the plow drivers why this happens and a very nice one said that the road is on the list but ever since Milwood Street and Granville St. became 1 way, the drivers have to circle back around Granite Ave to plow my mother's road and that the driver needs to plow the road from Milwood Street up my mothers road across Milton St. as from down from Milton St. to Milwood St there is no place to put the snow.  Two things changed this year, My mother's neighbor who helped her has moved away for winters and my mother fractured her knee cap so has caretakers come to the house, change in shift is 6:15AM and a nurse, physical therapist, and occupational therapist need to get to my mother's house.  My mother has been able to get by with the help of her neighbor during the winter but he is gone now. Inconvenience is not an acceptable excuse to not plow a for a 91 year old, tax paying, 61 year resident of Dorchester.  Please advise me on how to make sure Milwood Terrace gets plowed so my mother can continue to live in her house. I know Mayor Walsh is supportive of keeping elderly residents in their homes instead of institutions, especially during COVID.  Thank You. |</p>
<p><em>2020-12-17 - 02134</em><br />Please plow properly.  Our <strong>taxes</strong> don't pay for something to be half done. Can't get in or out from this intersection</p>

If it is public, there should be public access and, also, the owners would have been using the alley as private property while paying no property <strong>taxes</strong> on it. Can you please let me know if the alley is public or private or direct me to someone who can tell me? Thank you. | What is the intended occupancy: [Don't know.]  What is illegal about current use: [Possible blocking of a public way for private use.]  Which unit is illegal: [21 and 21A, maybe]  How many mailboxes: [Don't know]  How many doorbells: [Don't know]</p>

The $25 fee per unit is ridiculous and the city's way to create revenue without directly raising <strong>taxes</strong>. The inspectional services department is disorganized and inconsistent. Constantly catches them in lies. Is gaining signatures to file a class action lawsuit against the city. Would be fine with inspectional services performing inspections if they did a good job and were consistent. Upset with the new policy because it is hurting smaller landlords and favoring section 8 housing. States that section 8 is usually the only housing that requires inspections, and it is not fair for everyone to meet this requirement. Is disappointed in Mayor Menino and thought he was doing a great job up until this. Refuses to pay registration fees.</p>

All their trash was thrown on the sidewalks, most inside bags but others outside of bags. Trash should be kept inside trash bins/barrels due to the alarming amount of rats, mice and rodents that trash on public areas attract. Moreover, this building should be fined or warned for this. This is NOT the first time they leave trash out on the sidewalk on a Monday night. I pay my property <strong>taxes</strong> to the city of Boston.

They are parked outside of their property boundaries. They pay city <strong>taxes</strong> on the property and as it seems to be a business presumably have a city-issued business permit. Residents on this street receive notice each year about CITY requirements for clearing the sidewalk of snow implying the city assumes responsibility for to ticketing those who don't clear snow and therefore that it has jurisdiction over the sidewalk. Please deal with this issue. It has been improving but they still often at least partly block the sidewalk and in winter any blocking of it makes passing hazardous.</p>

<p><em>2013-07-31 - 02129</em><br />Request type:  [Other]   Details:  [Email from constituent:I wanted to make you aware that there were 3 mattresses that were out in the back Fire Alley @ 20 Pleasant Street.  I was told that the City of Boston did an inspection and they did not have bed bugs!  There is a mattress on the roof and one mattress still out in the back of 20 Pleasant Street.  I am sure they have a bed bug infestation in that property.  I have done 3 consecutive bed bug treatments after first washing, drying and dry-cleaning all my initial tenants clothing.  My tenants moved out because of the infestation.After all my tenants moved out, I got a new pest company and they did three consecutive treatments - and drilled and sprayed between the walls - they recommended I seal all my floors and I have had all my hardwood floors in the entire building refinished.  Now that 20 Pleasant St has put out mattresses once again, they probably have sprayed and once again my new tenant on the second floor has had bed bugs. 20 Pleasant Street tenants had 3 mattresses in the back and one on the roof plus other furniture in the back alley.  Currently they have one mattress out back and one on the roof.  I am certain that they have bed bugs and until they do appropriate treatment they will continue to have them.  This is vile!  Can you send someone to remove the mattresses from  the alley and the roof as well as have someone go to that property and do appropriate bed bug treatments?  As long as the city of Boston does not want to foreclose on this property for some reason that I cannot understand, I think they have a moral obligation to rid the property of bed bugs.  As you are aware all my tenants moved out because of the bed bugs that came from 20 Pleasant Street (they put out mattress with blood back months ago) then right after that my tenants got bed bugs.  Now that they have put out the mattresses again, I am sure they sprayed - I now have bed bugs in one of my units again.  The pest control person has spent a day once again at my cost taking care of this - plus my tenant had to put everything he owns through laundry and a hot dryer.In addition, this week, one of the neighbors told me that they were fighting in the street and they hear a baby crying ALL DAY LONG - there are countless people coming and going from this property and there is screaming and yelling - babies crying and nothing good going on in this property.  I wonder if I did not pay my real estate <strong>taxes</strong>, how long it would take before I was foreclosed on.  Who do these people know and why are they allowed to be disturbing the peace, causing issues for everyone around them, abuse the children, not pay their <strong>taxes</strong> and yet they are allowed to remain in the property.I am desperate to get these issues resolved; can you follow up with me and let me know the steps that will be taken for a resolution.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your time. "Dear Mr. Gillooly, I am writing to you in an attempt to express my frustration over a situation that seems unresolvable, but is causing anxiety in my daily work life and in the lives of our co-workers. I am a hard working single income woman. I pay my <strong>taxes</strong>, I own a condo in Dorchester and try to support this city in every way I can. I work on E. Broadway in South Boston. I work very hard and I love what I do. The problem as you may have already guessed is lack of parking for the dedicated Southie work force. Taking the T is not a possibility for me as I need access to my car during the day for appointments. I realize this is a "big picture" issue, but some awareness needs to be raised around supporting Boston's neighborhood businesses by not punishing the workers each day with a penalty for attempting to deliver services to its own community! I personally do not make enough money to be spending $75-$125 per week on parking tickets, not to mention the penalties that will accumulate if I don't have the money within the 21 day billing period. I leave Southie every day by 6pm allowing the space that I occupy during the day for the South Boston residents at night when the demand is the highest. It seems short-sighted for the city not to consider the value the small businesses bring to our neighborhood "Main Streets" by fining us daily to work here. Please take my request seriously. My co-workers are in the same situation as well as many other workers on E. Broadway. I am sure a solution can be made by offering a permit system during the day for the local business.

Public Sidewalk Cleaning | Comments on the Policy or Program: Copied directly from Constituent's e-mail: " Good morning, I am a Boston resident and would like to file a complaint about the current condition of the public sidewalks. While the sidewalk areas in front of residential areas and businesses are almost all as clear as could be expected, most of the sidewalks in city-owned and public areas are a dangerous icy mess. As a person with a broken shoulder who has slipped multiple times this winter on the sidewalks, I find this to be entirely unacceptable. Attached are two photos I took this morning, one from in front of Copp's Hill Terrace on Commercial Street and the other from the intersection of Causeway Street and North Washington Street next to the Charlestown Bridge. The portion in front of Copp's Hill Terrace was particularly treacherous and was a solid sheet of ice for about 25 yards. I found myself having to climb over the snowbank to walk in the middle of the traffic filled road; keep in mind that the residential sidewalks adjacent to this stretch were completely clear and safe. While I understand this winter has been relentless, since I pay thousands and thousands of dollars in <strong>taxes</strong>, I would really appreciate it if some of that money could go towards clearing the roads so I can walk to work safely, so I can earn the money I mostly have to pay back in <strong>taxes</strong>. Perhaps some of the money being used to pay over 9,000 state workers exorbitant six figure salaries could be reallocated to Public Works and clearing walkways, as ensuring the safety of city residents might be a slightly more worthwhile use of funds. I look forward to your reply. Thank you for your time. Best, Victoria Brophey"</p>

Fire Inspections | Comments on the Policy or Program: Good Evening Mayor Walsh and Council, I am writing to you to enforce the idea that a total repeal of the ordinance is still the first choice of property owners who pay over 70 percent of the <strong>taxes</strong> in Boston. The second choice would be a five year fire safety inspection with a letter from an electrician documenting that there are working and up to date fire alarms inside each unit. The focus of this inspections is limited to the common areas, basements, utility rooms, fire escapes, porches and exteriors unless there is a SERIOUS issue which indicates significant and serious interior violations during the common area inspection. The second option is a huge compromise on the part of tenants and landlords, but is a far better alternative than the full inspection citing picky cosmetic items which will raise rent tremendously. I believe that many local cities and towns already have a fire safety inspection. Thank You, Dawna Carrette</p>

Space Savers | Comments on the Policy or Program: Hello Mayor Walsh, My name is Kate Nolan and I am a South Boston resident. I have lived in Southie for over 13 years. I am a home owner and pay city <strong>taxes</strong>. In recent years I have noticed that people are keeping their space savers out for longer periods of time and even put them out before the snow falls. I live in Thomas park and parking is tough without the snow. This has been a brutal winter but parking in Southie has been worse then the weather. Something needs to change!! I hope you and your office can help! Sincerely, A very frustrated Southie resident</p>

Boston MBTA subway in general is very old and inefficient but Red line is the worst. My husband and I both work in Downtown and we are late to work half the time in Winter time and doesn't matter how early we leave home. During the past weeks we have been asked to evacuate the train three times. We got off the train in the middle of the way in the cold after being stuck in train for over 20 minutes. Why this needs to be the case in a city like Boston while we pay very high <strong>taxes</strong> comparing with national ave. and on Red line that is used by working Professionals and students of two of the best universities of the country!? I would highly appreciate any action to improve our public transportation system. Thanks, Mona</p>

<p><em>2014-02-04 - 02130</em><br />I though Boston was going to do something about all these scumbags bothering people at every red light in the city. I mean its bad enough there's junkies all over the city, nodding off in mcd's on mass ave or any other doorstep they can find. Think about it everyone. Your tax money is paying to get them high. But really BPD, if you see people begging for change I know theres not much you can do, but please just tell them to beat it. Thank you guys for everything else you guys do, You are under appreciated.  And for everyone else who gives them change...your only encouraging their behavior. I once saw the guy on morrisey blvd at freeport, go behind the bushes and pull out a wad of cash. Most of them are probably making a hundred or more a day, and they definitely arent paying <strong>taxes</strong>.</p>

<p><em>2014-01-04 - 02125</em><br />Description: [I don't understand why, but for some reason, the city does not clean Rowell Street. It's never cleaned and not on any regular street cleaning routes like Cushing Street. The amount of crud that has built up along the curbs is pretty darn gross.This is a downhill one-way street that many residents on Jones Hill use to exit the neighborhood, so it's frequently being used. With the wind blowing debris down the street on a regular basis, it can look really dirty and unkempt here.Since all the residents on Rowell St pay <strong>taxes</strong> like everyone else in city, why are we not afforded the same city services like everyone else?This street definitely needs some attention and a clean up effort by the city should be planned for the spring, since we pay the same as everyone else and don't get our fair share of street cleaning services.What do we need to do to get street cleaning services?Thank you,Mary Woods]</p>

Surely the tickets will be issued for street cleaning! Then of course, since the streets weren't cleared of snow and ice, it will considered a "holiday" for the street cleaners.  THE STUATION IS A MAJORITY SECURITY ISSUE FOR FIRE DEPARTMENT OR OTHER EMERGENCY VEHICLES.  Why not be proactive for once Boston!!! Use the street cleaning requirement to actually clean the streets of snow and ice so they are actually safe. The street cleaners get paid either way with our hard earned <strong>taxes</strong>!  Why not get out there and work to make a better city instead of being complacent leaving dirty snow and ice on street cleaning days allowing the mess of ice etc.to  exemplify a shameful lack of civic pride in doing a good job for the city that employs you and the citizens that count on you doing a good job!

I notice the rest of the City has them everywhere, but none for So.Boston. The North End has one on every corner, none for So.Boston. The filthy, ugly barrells that are there now are constantly overflowing with trash ,blowing all around the street. The City/BPW treats So.Boston like a foreign country. The streets are filthy, the trash barrells are never empty and it shows. We have thousands of people walking around all day and night. BPW should be in So. Boston cleaning up this mess. I never see BPW trucks here, but they are everywhere else. We pay <strong>taxes</strong> to have our streets clean, but the City/BPW does not clean here. I believe solar barrells will help because they can replace the ugly overflowing barrells that are there now. Please put them in the locations requested so we can start making So.Boston streets clean again.]</p>

Even so, with above and TV as well as fans on for 'white noise', the incessant, incredibly loud noise of planes from Logan is unbearable. Enjoyment of the Emerald Necklace and its surrounding community is being destroyed. This past Sunday was remarkable for plane noise, which was so loud and frequent that one could not differentiate moments between airplanes, which occurs often. It is so not okay to destroy our neighborhoods! Mayor Menino, please before you leave office call this terrible detriment to our neighborhoods to the attention of those who may have responsibility for the serious assault on Boston's growing and significant communities. If this assault on our ability to enjoy our premises in Jamaica Plain at the Pond continues, we may be forced to leave our community, which we do not wish to do. We have lived here peacefully since 1987 and paid our <strong>taxes</strong> willingly and on time. To do so in the future will depend on how seriously this issue is addressed. This may seem insignificant in the light of other issues, but you and the men and women who represent us should do some fact finding, as well as try to sleep during this assault. I thank you so much for your leadership and hope that you will assist us with this very difficult issue. Kindest regards, Lucia K. Badger, M.S., M.Ed., Judge Baker Children's Center 241 Perkins Street, C406 Jamaica Plain, MA 02130</p>

Leans on a Home from a Code Enforcement Citation | Comments on the Policy or Program: Constituent is concerned due a code enforcement ticket that has now become a lean on her home, preventing her from refinancing. She received a ticket for putting construction debris on the sidewalk, which she successfully appealed. At the hearing, she was informed about a second ticket concerning the same trash- she got a ticket after moving the debris from the sidewalk back to her property. She had never received the second ticket, hence her not knowing of it until the hearing. She recieved a letter forgiving her of the ticket for construction debris on the sidewalk, and had believed this letter dismissed her of both tickets. She admits it may have been an incorrect assumption on her part, but aftershe received that letter she did not hear anything after in terms of the second ticket (such as a late notice) which cemented her beliefs that it was dismissed as well. It bothers her that if the second ticket was not dismissed, she should have been notified. She is upset that she did not receive a second notice informing her that she needed to pay or it would effect her <strong>taxes</strong>. She had no idea that the code enforcement tickets would effect her <strong>taxes</strong>/home and at this point is even moreso upset because now that it is attached as a lean on her home, everyone is telling her that there is nothing they can do. She wishes they were better about delivering the tickets in the first place, how unclear the relation to leans and <strong>taxes</strong> from code enforcement tickets. She also has been given conflicting information from code enfrocement/isd. She had sent in ticket inquiries to Code Enforcement, per the request of two code enforcement staff members, and never received any response. She thinks that the procedure should be improved and would like to have a hearing and to get someone to look into her case as well, to help her resolve the lean.</p>

He was coming off of Harvard St. to turn into Brookline and they are all just in the middle of the street. They basically do what they want to do.

The bicyclist gave him attitude and started yelling at him then refused to move his bike from the street (non-bike lane), thus holding up traffic.

Mr. Kane states that the man at the window offered to go and get Celia for him to speak with. Mr. Kane said thank you but noticed that on the way to get Celia the man stop and spoke with another man. After they spoke one of the men came over and it turned out to be Mr. Portnoy. Mr. Kane asked if he was Celia, Mr. Kane then states that Mr. Portnoy replied no and asked, Whats your problem? Mr. Kane says he was taken aback by the abruptness and after several minutes of frustration asked to speak to the supervisor Celia. Mr. Portnoy said sure and left. After a few moments Mr. Kane states another man came in to speak with him, Mr. Hutchinson. Mr. Kane states he asked Mr. Hutchinson if he was Celia and Mr. Hutchinson replied no, to speak with her he would have to make an appointment. Mr. Kane states that he then asked Mr.Hutchinson if he could make an appointment to meet Celia with him, Mr.Hutchinson said no and that he would have to call her to a make an appointment. Mr. Kane states that he was disappointed that the situation was handled poorly and did not feel like it had to be as hostile as it was. He stated that he understood proper documentation is needed but that the letter the city sent out was very vague. He states that he believes the issue should have been dealt with in a more professional manner. He believes the language and tone of the conversation he had with Mr. Portnoy and Mr. Hutchinson was not professional and felt like he was being run around. He states that the situation should have been handled better and that the letter the city sends out should be re-evaluated because it is not clear.</p>

Free School Lunches & Boston Public Schools | Comments on the Policy or Program: Constituent is from New Bedford and wants to know who is paying for the free lunches. He also is curious as to why the BPS has so many employees. He believes that we send our low income people to his town. He wants to know why their <strong>taxes</strong> go up to pay for everyone in Boston but his city sees no money from Boston. He wants assistance in his town and wants to know why the City of Boston gets all sorts of money and funding and ships their low income families out of the city. He is also upset with the toll prices and the use of funds within Boston.

<p><em>2014-10-20 - 02131</em><br />What is the nature of the problem? : Constituent entered the case via Mayor's Email: I really would like to see the Walsh administration clean up the property located at 1402 CENTRE ST in West Roxbury "Weld American" an abandoned automotive repair bldg that has been crumbling apart for over a decade. The Menino administration ignored it for over a decade. Matt O'Malley counselor has attempted to get this cleaned up over the years, but has not been successful. Kids smash windows, trees grow from the roof. There is a great need for parking in that area for the businesses. The City should have the BRA take this property for "real Urban Blight" and perhaps make it a parking lot for the community businesses. It is truly an eye sore. Now it has graffiti all over the side of bldg #1408 Centre. It's looking ghetto here. Too much in <strong>taxes</strong> to have to look at this. Please don't turn a blind eye on this very needed cleanup. Thank you</p>

Rather than send someone out hours after this message is posted and then you respond that the area was checked and it was clear, how about assigning someone to the area to patrol it?

I drive by this stretch approximately 12 times a day for the last 4 years and can honestly count on one hand how many times I have seen it without cars double parked as well as how many BTD employees i have seen in the area.

The money is going to go to extra police control and they are going to become very rich which she doesn't want to have to pay in <strong>taxes</strong>. Constituent reports we also don't need the building that he wants to build. She says it will only be for him so that the mayor can have his name on it. Constituent says the Olympics does not have to come to the US because it will bring terrorist attacks and money issues. The constituent wants to know how strong are people going to be if we have another terrorist attack in US. Constituent says that he should really think about not having the Olympics in Boston because only something bad will happen. The constituent wants the mayor to be responsible if anything bad happens.

<p><em>2020-07-23 - 02128</em><br />Details: This building has been renovated without permits. Unit #3 on the third floor was renovated over several weeks in early 2018. Unit #1 was renovated in fall of 2018. I don't know the condition of unit #2. I previously rented unit #1 (from 2013-2018), and the owner, Chris Marchi, made it clear that he had some pretty strong feeling about ISD and the permitting process, so I wasn't at all surprised when I recently came across some rental advertisements for unit #1 that confirm what I had suspected--that the unit would be renovated once I moved out, similar to how unit #3 had been renovated once that tenant moved out. However, I am absolutely shocked at how much unit #1 has been changed. All of the kitchen and plumbing fixtures were replaced, which wasn't surprising being that all of the kitchen and plumbing fixtures in #3 were replaced immediately once that tenant moved out in 2018, but a gas fireplace was also installed, and the entire layout of the unit was changed. The former entrance to the bathroom was walled-over and a new entrance was created, a wall was removed between the living room and the kitchen, a wall was added in the former dining area to create a second bedroom, etc. The extent of these changes is downright scary. Current photos are available on the internet (just google the address), but I also have some "before" photos, if there is a way to get them to you. Though the Hansen and Sceris databases would make it appear that this building hasn't changed in decades, this isn't the case at all. In addition to the interior renovations, there's been a new roof, new boilers, new vinyl siding, new windows and gutters, etc. despite there not ever being any permits. Note that Mr. Marchi uses an unlicensed contractor named Everaldo Barbosa, who has never applied for a permit in his life (according to Hansen). I've seen Mr. Barbosa's van all over the city the last few years, but he's not even a licensed HIC. It's just him and some other guy. His van says "since 2007" and "fully insured" (I have photos of this, too), but these are misleading claims. He started his LLC in 2017 (Everaldo Construction Inc.), and before that his van had some other decal for a company called Built Right (or something like that). I think it's disgusting what Marchi and Barbosa are doing to the City of Boston, and that they flaunt the rules so blatantly without any fear of repercussions, so if there's anything further I can do to help (with providing photos, timelines, etc.), please let me know. Mr. Marchi should be penalized in some way, and needs to start paying his fair share of property <strong>taxes</strong>, and Mr. Barbosa needs to stop masquerading around as an HIC, especially considering that he's likely under-bidding and stealing work from honest, licensed contractors who follow the rules. However, most important of all, is that this property undergoes a thorough safety inspection. This is a very dense neighborhood with old housing stock, and it's very worrisome that someone without any training/license would be installing fireplaces and replacing gas ranges. How many other properties in East Boston has Mr. Barbosa remodeled? Thank you for looking into this.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-05 - 02132</em><br />Description: None of the snow has been removed from this area. The streets have been cleared of the snow so cars can go by but all the snow has been dumped to the sidewalks and sides of the roads up to 4 feet high on some places. So it's next to impossible to cross any streets. I take bus 38 with my 3.5 year old every day and we have to walk on the street and wait for the bus ON THE STREET. It's one of the busiest streets out there and there is an accident waiting to happen. The snow also has not been cleared at the traffic light on South Street and Centre. So When I need to cross the street I have to walk around all the driving cars. Cross walks are all blocked with snow. I pay my <strong>taxes</strong>. How come West Roxbury has been cleaned and our Roslindale stress are left with mounds of snow? Clearly my tax dollars are being used to clean other neighborhoods. I'm very disappointed that we do not get the same attention as some other areas and that I have to risk not only my safety but also my kid's safety.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-04 - 02126</em><br />I miss Mayor Menino , never let us down. Always made sure his City was cleaned and taken care of. My street hasn't been plowed, nor has my trash been picked up. I could have sworn the reason I pay high property <strong>taxes</strong> includes trash removal and street clean up. I've called Mayor's Hotline 5x and made 3 previous reports on here. Still nothing!!! Thanks Marty for 24 hrs Downtown, City Hall, & Beacon Hill man power clean up, while children are risking their lives walking in busy streets to get to unshoveled bus stops.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-04 - 02116</em><br />Case (SR) Type: Miscellaneous | Referred To: CONSTITUENT/24 HOUR SERVICES | Description: I would like to file a formal complaint. The snow situation is out of control in the neighborhoods, and the prioritizing of the parade route was a huge misstep. For those of us who actually live and work in the city, the past few days have been terrible. The T hasn't been running and traffic has been gridlocked. I have been walking to and from work since Monday because of these issues, trudging through uncleared sidewalks and often walking in the streets, which aren't cleared either. Parades are nice but they are a luxury, one that we should not put before the more basic needs of those who live and work here. I am a constituent. I vote and pay <strong>taxes</strong>. And my city is not working for me right now. Get it together so we can get to work safely, and kids can get to school safely. This is an embarrassment. And stop using the amount of snow as an excuse. It is all about priorities and in this case the city's priorities were all wrong.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-04 - 02115</em><br />Unshovelled location: Sidewalk | City Owned: Yes | Agency Name: City of | Details: It's incredibly irresponsible of the city to have a major pedestrian walkway unshoveled. The only reason its not as high as other snow piles is due to people trying to go over it. If they are unable to walk through the snow, they walk in the street- which due to the snow piles, is also unsafe since cars can't see them. Either move the snow piles or shovel the sidewalks. Furthermore, the fact that the city can't shovel sidewalks properly, leaving a layer of ice under the snow when everyone else can shovel to the pavement is unacceptable. Frankly, I'm incredibly disappointed to see my <strong>taxes</strong> going toward throwing a parade for people who are not even residents than helping those of us who live and work here get around safely. Do better, please. | Exact location: All of it, starting at park drive and headed toward downtown</p>
<p><em>2015-02-04 - 02118</em><br />Complaint about Public safety concern: No | , Other: No | Description: Constituent says that the street has not been cleared yet and people pay a lot in <strong>taxes</strong> to take care of it.

Snow Removal | Comments on the Policy or Program: Roxbury/Dorchester/Mattapan - constituent reports that she is not able to get around these streets in these neighborhoods and that the city needs to do a better job of cleaning up. Constituent says she pays <strong>taxes</strong> and it is not attractive that the city does not clean the side street.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-04 - 02129</em><br />Why is Bunker Hill St in this condition? 1 lane because there has been zero snow removal but the New England Patriots get Boylston down to the curb and pavement? Who pays <strong>taxes</strong> in the city? Me or the Patriots that play in Foxboro? This is a disgrace and very very dangerous! The T had to divert to its snow route 32 hours after the storm stopped because buses barely fit up Bunker Hill St!</p>
<p><em>2015-02-03 - 02137</em><br />Special Condition: Not Passable | Additional details: Every street in our neighborhood has been plowed but ours. I cannot get out of my driveway due to this problem. I saw a contract plow driver look at our street and just drive past. What? Why? We pay <strong>taxes</strong> too! Please clean our street.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-03 - 02115</em><br />Special Condition: Not Passable | Additional details: Public Alley 430 is STILL not passable at the Mass Ave end, meaning that residents have significant difficulty getting in and out of their parking areas especially when commercial vehicles are blocking the alley, which is often. I submitted this same request 6 days ago, when are you going to take care of this? How do I get a pro-rated credit on my property <strong>taxes</strong>? What the hell am I paying for?</p>
<p><em>2015-02-03 - 02115</em><br />Scheduled trash day: Mon/Thurs | How was your trash placed out for collection? Trash bag | Is your trash curbside pickup or an alley? Alley | Does the trash contain any construction material, paints, plumbing fixtures or tires?

<p><em>2015-02-03 - 02118</em><br />Please plow alley 719. This is absurd. We paid for our spots and can't access them due to the lack of public alley plowing. Glad Boylston is a priority - pretty sure most of those guys don't pay Boston city <strong>taxes</strong> like the residents of the South End.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-02 - 02126</em><br />Made 3 calls and this is my second report. Unbelievable Patriots parade high priority compared to long time hard working citizens to have streets plowed in order to safely commute to work. This is unfair. We pay high property <strong>taxes</strong> but can't have our streets plowed and sanded to be able to safely. This street was never plowed from the last blizzard.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-02 - 02118</em><br />East Springfield St. and Public Alley #719 were plowed at about 6:15AM, have not been touched since.  At this point they are now only accessible by trucks and SUVs.  My car was pushing snow down E Springfield when I got home at 4:00.  No chance at all of getting to my space in the alley.  I guess this storm will be no different than the last one.  People who pay <strong>taxes</strong> will be prevented from using the property they pay <strong>taxes</strong> on because BPW is to lazy to completely do their job.  Despite at least 25 calls and postings from this house alone.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-02 - 02201</em><br />Description: I have lived in the city for 20 years, I live at Burroughs Wharf on the Waterfront. This is the second time that I feel I need to contact the city. I noticed this past summer that the city and streets were just dirty. Now I have to tell you that the plowing of streets and sidewalks and snow removal are very poor. What is going on? I pay very high property and excise <strong>taxes</strong> and am not happy at all!!</p>
<p><em>2015-01-31 - 01210</em><br />Special Condition: Not Passable | Additional details: barely passable I opened case 101001258791 to take care of it. I waited almost 3 days and i came home last night to an even bigger mess. I am unable to use my car because there is a 5' tall pile of ice and snow that the city so graciously left at the end of my driveway. its frozen solid, so i guess i'm waiting until it melts before i use my car again. This is the absolute worst condition this street has been in in almost 15 years. You people are pathetic, did you forget how to plow? Seriously... i pay my <strong>taxes</strong> and i clear my sidewalks, oh and by the way, the plow pushed all the snow onto half my sidewalk... so now my sidewalk is impassible and i have to fix that or you'll fine me... this is completely unacceptable. Fix it now please</p>
<p><em>2015-01-30 - 02150</em><br />Type of request: Sign | Details: Hello i am a resident from Brooks St i have notice that since the past year parking has become an issue many cars have been vandalize. I have notice that many cars from out of state plates or commercial cars park there all the time. We pay <strong>taxes</strong> and believe that the least thing the city can do for the residents from Brooks St is to make that area residential only. I am a single mother, i work at night time sometimes until midnight or later and always struggling with parking. A year ago i got robbed by a male. My neighbor almost got ripe because she had no other option but to park her car about 3 blocks away from her house.

<p><em>2015-01-28 - 02130</em><br />Special Condition: Not Passable | Additional details: The City STILL HAS NOT PLOUGHED OUR STREET! NONE OF THE CARS CAN GET OUT. WHAT IS GOING ON? THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. MANY OF MY NEIGHBORS AND I HAVE CALLED BUT NOTHING IS HAPPENING!!! I think what we need is a front loader now - a plough that can dump the snow into a dumpster as if it simply ploughed at this point there would be no place to put the snow. We are a dead end street. If the City had ploughed on Monday evening and then Tuesday, I think it would be fine. This is really outrageous, to think that we all are paying <strong>taxes</strong> and get no street help! Please contact me ASAP. Kevin Whalen</p>
<p><em>2015-01-28 - 02128</em><br />Unshovelled location: Sidewalk | City Owned: No | Details: I shoveled off my sidewalk which exists in front of 123 Webster Street and halfway down Cottage Street. This morning someone (a plow) had pushed all the snow from the street onto the handicapped corner making it unpassable. I then re-shoveled a path for people to walk in. I do not want to be responsible for snow I cannot remove and removed twice when someone with a plow carelessly made the roadway larger and plowed a "mountain" of snow onto my sidewalk corner. I cannot remove it. I have a back injury and should not be shoveling at all. I do not want to receive a citation because the handicapped ramp is not shoveled. I CAN"T DO IT - ONCE never mind TWICE. Also yesterday a neighbor who owns 2 houses and is a policeman at Station 7 in East Boston was telling his tenants it was OK to throw snow into the street. They proceeded to clean off their car and throw large amounts of snow into the middle of Cottage Street. Does a homeowner who is a police officer have the right to make up his own rules about snow removal to keep his tenants happy. This is downright unfair. I pay <strong>taxes</strong> - he is not the mayor of my street or of Boston and has no right to make his own rules. He owns 16 - 18 Cottage Street. He does not live there. He gets along with no neighbors - his sidewalk looks like it is in Florida. No trace of snow - all of it was blown into the middle of Cottage Street to make the roadway inpassable. | Exact location: corner</p>
<p><em>2015-01-27 - 01125</em><br />Idiots are tossing snow into the just plowed street. My <strong>taxes</strong> aren't paying to have this done 15 times because people are lazy and inconsiderate.</p>
<p><em>2015-01-27 - 02126</em><br />Streets needs to be plowed and sanded so that hard working citizens can walk to the "T" to go to work since the Mayor has lifted the State of Emergency knowing it's unsafe to commute to work. Since us Hard working citizens can't afford to loose our jobs in order to pay high costs of city <strong>taxes</strong>. Please plow/sand the streets and roads so we can safely commute in the streets to work.</p>
<p><em>2015-01-25 - 02133</em><br />It is unfortunate that I have called for my father and I know his neighbors have called to alert the city of the lack of snow removal on Orlando street and Newcastle street in Mattpan.  My father pays <strong>taxes</strong> and should receive the services of proper snow removal along with sand and salt. He hasn't gotten these services from the city.  If I call on his behalf I get a very nice response but no results.   There is a breakdown in the follow through process.  I'm concern this is occurring more often than  not and it needs to stop.  I shouldn't have to monitor this service at all.   It is a disgrace when the city isn't providing the proper services to their citizens.  My father is 80 years old and should be treated with respect and should be provided the services when every one else receives it. He lives at 160 Orlando street and across the street from him are other elderly neighbors in their 70's and 80's.  I always hear how the city cares for their elderly.  I'm expecting a resolution.

<p><em>2015-01-14 - 02201</em><br />Where is the pothole? On Roadway | Additional information: Dear City of Boston, It would be greatly appreciated if you took a little time out of your busy scheduled day to hear my concern. I am a 17 year old student I was driving to school like any other normal day, going slower than the speed limit on 290 South St Jamaica Plain, MA 02130-3514, on Wednesday December 10th. Since it is known for outrageous traffic at 6:45 in the morning. As I was driving, I was caught by complete shock when my car hit a pothole almost  foot deep with a metal frame corners sticking out in the pothole which is the water sewer. Not only did this cause damage to my car, it made a huge loud noise inside my car that frightened me as my car was shifted out of my control on to the upcoming traffic. My read and front tire popped while I was in moving action. Although I am safe and very fortunate to have avoided any car accident, this could have been life threatening. I am very upset by this, because even with the rainy weather, the pothole was filled with water and was in the middle of the lane on a street with two lane traffic: there was no way to avoid. Driving safe is something emphasized and influenced on Bostonian drivers, and for our safety there shouldn't be an almost  ft. deep hole in the middle of the street with a metal frame. I am very upset by this, because there was no warning of a giant hole in the middle of the street. A caution cone or caution tape but there wasnt. It was raining hard which made the hole much more difficult to be visible. It would be much appreciated if next time construction at least put a warning up or filled in these pot holes that possibly threatened my life. We all pay large amounts of <strong>taxes</strong> to ensure that our roads will be safe and repaired. Now I am stuck paying over 600 dollars on tires and car repairs, when I should be using that money to pay off my college applications. It is not fair for me to pay off my car damages when I was obeying the laws, and the city of Boston cant fix a hole in the middle of the street that is life threatening. I believe the City of boston is responsible, because I already filed a claim and investigation but Boston water sewer commission and they told met that the sewer was in tact and that the road around it was the problem, since it was a huge hole around the sewer and the reason my tires exploded which is 100% true. I should receive reimbursement for my car damages.I should not be responsible for paying damages that this caused, because I was doing what any normal driver would be doing. A response would be greatly appreciated, since this had happened completely out of my favor. I also have a picture of the pothole that I have attached. I want reimbursement for the car damages without legal action, because it is not a lot of money. I have a copy of the receipt of the car damages that I will send when I get a response. Contact me and 857 249 6587. I have pictures of the pothole, I have already spoke to Marty Walsh's office and have spoke with Barbara from boston sewer commission and it's been a long time to get down to who is responsible. I have a ton of evidence and a response will be greatly appreciated, because it is proven that you are responsible for the huge pothole. Also, the day of the incident, I tweeted the pothole and a chief of staff responded and the next day the pothole was fixed. Although the pothole was fixed, it still caused damage and I want my money for it. | Size of the pothole: A couple of feet and it was very deep</p>

The <strong>taxes</strong> have been paid for fiscal 2014, but are in arrears for fiscal 2015. Can anything be done about this? It is unfair to the neighbors to have to put up with this eyesore. Thank you for your consideration. Marion Diener</p>

<p><em>2014-12-01 - 02128</em><br />Case (SR) Type: Assessing | Referred To: ASSESSING DEPARTMENT | Description: Phyllis is extremely upset about the process she has gone through regarding her 2014 property <strong>taxes</strong>. Phyllis lives in 17 Shipway Place, Charlestown. In 2013 she noticed that her <strong>taxes</strong> were higher than comparable units around her. She filed for an appeal and was awarded a lower property tax. In 2014 her property tax went back up to what it was in the previous year. Phyllis filed an appeal again and Sherrie Turner came to inspect. Sherrie agreed upon a figure with Phyllis, but after presenting it to the board it was denied. Phyllis then filed an appeal with the State, and after a week Sherrie returned stating that the board made a mistake and was accepting the agreed upon figure. Phyllis was told that she would receive her reimbursement in early October. She was just told today by Laura Isberg that they are submitting the documentation to Treasury tomorrow, and that Phyllis will now not receive her check for 2 months. Phyllis is very upset with this process and would like her reimbursement now, not in two months.</p>

<p><em>2014-11-10 - 02113</em><br />Details: The property across the street from 59 Cooper St in the North End is being used as a parking lot and it's unclear to me who's supposed to maintain it. Please either reach out to the owner and request that the trash be collected ASAP or if the city owns that property, then please have someone clean up the sight. There is all kinds of garbage around the fences of this property and I feel that we pay enough <strong>taxes</strong> to have to look at that on a daily basis. If the city doesn't own the property, then please also advise the owner that any snow around the parking lot needs to be shoveled. That hasn't been the case in the last few years. Thanks in advance for your help. Regards, Nina</p>

<p><em>2014-11-03 - 02201</em><br />Case (SR) Type: Excise Tax | Referred To: TAX: COLLECTING | Description: update vai e-mail 11/21/14: On regards of case number #101001210155. See attached documentation confirming the excise tax from 2012 has been paid twice. Two bills were due on 2012. The bill in question 362189 is the one holding me back from renewing my registration see below. TRAC, City clerk nor window M31 wanted to honor the payment on 11/22/2013 presented in receipt form faxed and in person for their review. Ryan Kelly claims I need to pay excise <strong>taxes</strong> from 24 years ago on vehicles I do not even recognize as mines before they can release the lien for bill 362189 so I can pay for my registration and have transportation again. I been unable to go to work since 10/03/2014. When I showed Kelly Ryan previous "clear all" documentation from the registry, meaning if I had any fines pending they were cleared on 2005 and again on 2010 they say these are not valid. In reality regardless these clear all documents are originated by RMV in order to obtain these, constituents need to present to RMV proof of payments on all outstanding fines and obligation provided by the city/Ryan Kelly that there are no outstanding fines or excises. It states so very clearly on the document. The gentleman assisting me laugh at the scenario of not having actual receipts showing the exact numbers they are looking for. However financially what they are looking for is impossible and illegal based on the time that has transpired. They are not saying is due, but that they do not have proof is being paid yet when I ask for the bill or warrant, since this is so delinquent they do not produce any documentation to confirm such debts pending. Please call me to confirm receipt of these documents attached. [http://admin.sovereignbank.com/eBusinessCard/image.ashx/1060</p>
<p><em>2015-04-26 - 02201</em><br />Where is the pothole? On Roadway | Additional information: The section of Mass Ave. starting from the Mass Ave Bridge to almost Boylston street is a disaster. I also reported this back in August 2014 and I was impressed that I immediately got a phone call from Mark Lawson acknowledging and agreeing with my complaint and stating that something would be done about it. Much to my disappointment, nothing was done. I did notice that recently the city repaired ONLY the area where Marathon runners would step (and it was only done because of the Marathon...until then, dangerous conditions were ignored and cars were getting damaged). I am a marathoner myself...BUT I am a taxpayer 364 days out of the year and I am not paying <strong>taxes</strong> for only the sections of the road that I step on. I am paying <strong>taxes</strong> for all of the roads. There are also a series of large pothole at the Mass Pike entrance across from Newbury Street. I reported this last year as well and nothing was done. Now it is even worse. It is difficult to avoid these potholes while at the same time avoiding the pedestrians crossing that intersection. One day something bad is going to happen, which you could have avoided or prevented. I am sure you must have driven over it several times, so I don't know why it is ignored. Please finally repair these areas properly...possibly using Infrared Repair, which is the best and most long-lasting way of repairing large sections or potholes. I understand this was a harsh and damaging winter, but it has been over for a long time, and I reported these issues last year. | Size of the pothole: Large contiguous sections | Date when pothole noticed: 04/26/2015</p>
<p><em>2015-04-24 - 02124</em><br />Description: It appears that street cleaning on Huntoon St is much like the snow plowing last winter....basically ignored. The sweeper goes up and down Medway St but never goes onto Huntoon. Huntoon St probably pays more <strong>taxes</strong> than all of Medway. Please correct this problem.</p>
<p><em>2020-07-21 - 02201</em><br />The eviction moratorium should not be extended without some sort of funding to pay landlords. Private landlords should not be forced to bear the burden of tenants without any recourse or help from the government. Mortgages, <strong>taxes</strong>, insurance and maintenance still have to be paid when small landlords have been laid off too. Why do tenants specifically get a free pass?</p>

<p><em>2015-03-02 - 02135</em><br />Special Condition: Narrow/Request to Widen | Additional details: Now that residents who shoveled won't be permitted space-savers and will lose spaces to Brighton Ctr bars & restaurants, please get a crew out to clear Henshaw and Bentley Sts to the curbs so that the parking spaces on both sides lost to the plow berms (at least a dozen spaces on Henshaw alone) can be accessed by people who actually live here and pay <strong>taxes</strong> on their property and need to be able to come home with their kids and park within a block of their houses without losing spaces to the bar patrons. The side streets around here are unparkable except where people who live here shoveled. Thanks.</p>
<p><em>2015-03-01 - 02130</em><br />This sidewalk has not been shoveled once this winter. If Tommy was still mayor we would see more than "I issued a ticket that is all I can do."I will definitely remember the city's lack of response when the next election comes around. You may think this app is great but all it does is save you from personal contact with the folks who pay your salary through their <strong>taxes</strong>. Shame on you!</p>
<p><em>2015-02-27 - 02124</em><br />Additional details: I am absolutely disgusted that after you've reported spending $33M to remove snow, there still remains huge banks of snow where pedestrians are forced to walk in the streets, putting their safety in harm's way. We feel like beggars asking you to get off your slothful thinking and get this city in working shape but also like 2nd class citizens because "other" places in Boston look a lot better. But come to Dorchester and the place looks deserted and unloved. We pay our <strong>taxes</strong>, we vote and some of us voted for you and now you've got to earn your keep. Please get into the secondary streets and remove these mountains of snow. It is uncivilized for the "better" places in Boston/Charlestown/Copley/Newbury...then get to Dorchester and treat us equally. Enough is enough!</p>

<p><em>2015-02-26 - 02137</em><br />Additional details: Id like to know why the City of Boston feels its appropriate for a city front end loader to dump snow on my private property? Just because I pay property <strong>taxes</strong>, doesnt give the City of Boston the right to dump snow on my property. Please address this issue.</p>
<p><em>2020-07-22 - 02126</em><br />Why isn't MassDot responding to residents request to cut this overgrowth on a lot they own? Several reports have been made by area residents. For the amount of <strong>taxes</strong> we pay, this is unacceptable.</p>

Heard the city has extra people to pick up space savers, how about picking up the trash first! What's going on with the priorities of this administration. I've also called about the Fire hydrant we shoveled multiple times at the corner of Lagrange and brook farm road that dpw buried under ice and no one has fixed it. If there is a fire and the dept is delayed to the hydrant water I will bring up the record that the city did nothing and city workers re-buried the clearly exposed hydrant.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-25 - 02284</em><br />This is actually at South and East. But all of the barrels in the Leather District are full and people are just leaving garbage next to them. In fact, my wife politely asked a guy not to do it this morning and he went al, "I'm a resident and I pay <strong>taxes</strong>..." He was a jerk but could someone empty these? Michael Malyszko</p>
<p><em>2015-02-24 - 02137</em><br />Description: To Whom It May Concern, I have three concerns that I would like to address with the city: snow removal, trash removal and fire hydrants. SNOW REMOVAL: I'm not sure when and if snow removal will happen for the side streets, but at the intersection of Riverside Square, Pierce Street, and Arlington Street, there are three massive snow banks that prevents people from seeing if a car is coming or a person is walking down the street. There is also another snow bank near 752 Metropolitan Avenue. TRASH REMOVAL: Also, for about a month, they refuse to pick up the trash at property at 752 Metropolitan Avenue and 756 Metropolitan Avenue. According to Geraghty Associates, they stated that they have called several times for them to pick up the trash, but receive excuses. This is not acceptable to the residents who pay <strong>taxes</strong> to have their trash picked up. I understand that due to the back-to-back snow storms it was difficult for them to pick it up. Now that the weather is somewhat decent, I hope they pick up the trash this week. FIRE HYDRANTS: There are about two fire hydrants located near 752 Metropolitan Avenue that are still covered. I understand that they should have been plowed out, but I cannot get to it. The house near one of the hydrants put all its snow on the hydrant. This house is on the corner of River Street and Metropolitan Avenue. It is a yellow house. I don't know exactly where the other hydrant is. Is it possible that someone can clean the snow off the hydrants? Thank you. I know that you have a lot of calls, complaints, and other concerns to address. I sent this email to make sure that our streets are safe and no one gets hurt. Sincerely, Ermy</p>
<p><em>2015-02-23 - 01125</em><br />I have not been able to park on my street since February 2nd. These are public spaces meant for cars that are paid for by tax money. They are not meant for chairs and space savers that don't pay <strong>taxes</strong>. Please let me in my street!</p>
<p><em>2015-02-22 - 02116</em><br />Unlike the North End and the Back Bay and downtown, the South End feels as if it's been forgotten by the mayor and the city. Dwight Street is disgusting, with insane amounts of snow and trash because the trash collectors cannot make it down the street. I pay (a lot of) <strong>taxes</strong> and vote. Please do something to clean up Dwight Street and the South End.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-19 - 02116</em><br />Additional details: Street virtually impassable -school blocks street at Clarendon-as elementary kids need to be walked in by parents who leave cars on street -new no parking signs a joke -snow and cars extend 18 feet into street on both sides -a parking ban must include residential -at the very least alternate side parking - not to mention exorbitant Back Bay <strong>taxes</strong> which apparently only help out other neighborhoods</p>
<p><em>2015-02-19 - 01210</em><br />Hello I know my neighbors have called and sent reports about our street. Why hasn't is street been cleaned up? We pay the same amount in <strong>taxes</strong> as the rest of boston. We are entitled to a street that is Wennona for a fire truck her and wants to make its way down. What about the cars parked on the sidewalks ? Seems to me give each car a 50.00 ticket and that will pay to have the street cleaned and the sidewalks useable! Thanks .</p>
<p><em>2015-02-19 - 02026</em><br />You guys are useless you can't be fining people for not shoveling sidewalks because its not their dammmmm property it belongs to the city of Boston we pay <strong>taxes</strong> for the city to be clean you can't be forcing somebody to shovel something that don't belong to them you guys do it</p>
<p><em>2015-02-18 - 02201</em><br />Description: I live on the Waterfront and pay high <strong>taxes</strong>, sorry, but do not see any evidence of snow removal in the North End and Waterfront. Also the pot holes on Atlantic are a plentiful. Where are you removing snow and when do you expect to remove any of the huge snow banks in the North End, Waterfront and Financial District? Please get the crews out there and fill in the pot holes! It's hazardous to walk and drive in the city and you cannot keep using the excuse of "historic" snowfall. This is one very unhappy resident.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-18 - 02127</em><br />Doing a great job on snow removal on east Broadway but at the corner of I and Broadway- 1/2 way up hill still needs clearing - it is a full car and 1/2 into street.  Major intersection and lots of elderly trying to get on sidewalk to get hair done and <strong>taxes</strong>.Thanks for the great work you are doing in this unusual weather!</p>
<p><em>2015-02-17 - 02132</em><br />Witnessed incident: No | Details: Plowed snow has been lifted on to our flower beds and lawn. If you have GPS, you would be able to see which vehicle with front end lifting capabilities did this. We have not given express or implied consent for this dumping on to our private property. I also have concern for the structural safety of the underlying retaining wall. This was also done two years ago. This is unacceptable; we will be looking for an adjustment in our property <strong>taxes</strong> for the two applicable years. PLEASE get someone to plow in this area who has a minimal understanding of the concept of private property. | Case related to commercial waste: Unknown</p>
<p><em>2015-02-17 - 02215</em><br />How are these neighborhood restaurants (Audubon) supposed to survive in this "forgotten" section of Boston?  We pay the same <strong>taxes</strong> clear the snow so there's parking. Unacceptable.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-17 - 02134</em><br />This street has barely been plowed. It is a small one way one block lane - there is a 12+foot snow bank at one end and the residents are struggling to even drive down the street. One passerby commented "what happened - don't these people pay their <strong>taxes</strong>?" Sadly I said - they do. Please plow this street - it would take 10 minutes.</p>
<p><em>2015-02-14 - 02131</em><br />Additional details: I live at 96 Belgrade ave in Roslindale. the city has removed snow piles from both ends of of Belgrade Ave, where the business are but have left hugh piles of snow in front of all the residential homes. I am a home owner who pays my real estate <strong>taxes</strong> just like the business owners and expect the same service at they do. In from of my house there is grid lock of traffic because of the snow mounds which are out to the bicycle lanes and is going to be made worse with the next storm coming. When can I expect to have these mounds of snow removed. This is a safety hazard. thank you Barbara Sullivan 96 Belgrade Ave. Roslindale 02131</p>
<p><em>2015-02-13 - 02135</em><br />Unshovelled location: Sidewalk | City Owned: No | Details: owner died last june they had handicapped sign placed few years back since sibling lived there. Handicapped person has not lived there since last summer drug dealings taking place daily boston police can verify utilities and <strong>taxes</strong> not being paid yet living off the government, neither working of married couple with 3 children DCF should be involved.

<p><em>2015-04-29 - 02205</em><br />The closest intersecting street: Congress St | How is the car parked illegally? Fire lane | Details: Last night, 4/28, about 9pm, I called the Mayor's Hot Line and advised that 2 enormous moving trucks, one with MA plate and one with NH plate, with 1-888AIMCUBE on the side of the trucks, were parked in the fire lane directly behind the Children's Museum on Sleeper St., closest to Congress. Truck engines were running for HOURS, and parked in the wrong direction facing Seaport Blvd. Obviously causing traffic problems since Sleeper St. is a narrow street and 2 way traffic is a challenge when the street is clear! The AIM stands for Advanced Installations & Moving in Tyngsborough, MA. I contacted the Children's Museum today, and was told by their facilities manager, Marisa Lava, that the trucks were there for a move at 320 Congress St. -- at night! Probably no permit for after hours moving. And because the trucks ran their engines for HOURS, the diesel fumes went into the Museum's building. I called the Mayor's Hot Line, and it was suggested that I call the police. Not sure the police even showed up, since I could see the trucks from my condo window, and when I went to bed at 11:15, the trucks were still there. Very disappointing that the Mayor's Hot Line could not help, and the police didn't show up. When I told the drivers that they were parked in the fire lane, they used foul language and told me 'so what'. Suburban company, operating after hours, with surly drivers, parked illegally, with engines running illegally, and I'm a condo owner paying property <strong>taxes</strong>, and they essentially did exactly what they wanted to do without consequences. | Type of vehicle: Truck | Details: see above | Vehicle License Plate State: MA</p>

It has not been shoveled on either Street. SHA is getting worn down by foot traffic as it's along the main thorough fare. Sydney Street still remains 100% snow-covered. Four minutes after reporting it last night I got case closed note last night. I reported it and got a note saying K still closed no violation and that the person from the city had gone out 20 minutes earlier. Apparently they're not looking at the correct property as it is still not shoveled this morning. This man has been doing this for years. The building is abandoned and has a city of Boston seal on it  as Anthony has a year to pay his <strong>taxes</strong> before the city takes property from him.  I couldn't stop to take a picture this morning but it is still 100% snow snow-covered on Sidney Street.

<p><em>2016-06-28 - 02199</em><br />Problem: Other | Description: UPDATE Oct 20 2016: Hi Boston 311, I have called this problem to the attention of Public Works for over six years using both phone and 311. Each time they either ignore the phone calls by not calling back, do not respond to the 311 request, or respond with the same promise of waiting for the right time to do the work. Also during that time, their have been several substantial excavations on the street immediately below the "Temporary" Wire which would have allowed them to easily renew the underground wiring.. This is not fair. We, at the Belvedere Condominium building are paying millions of dollars a year in real estate <strong>taxes</strong> and all we are requesting is that they replace one simple wire. My questions to 311 are "Do you think that this is fair? Is there anything you can do to escalate my request? If not, is there anything I can do to escalate this request?" Thanks for the help, Gerald Entine Constituent states that temporary green wiring strung between street lights was supposed to be resolved months ago, but the wires are still there. Requests PWD fix the wiring/reach out to him with a timeline.</p>

<p><em>2016-06-14 - 02127</em><br />M Street Park, softball and Little League fields both need immediate cutting of the grass. Also, someone has removed the "No Dogs Allowed" signs from the Little League field. There were two dogs on the Little League field and four dogs on the softball fields at 7:00am today. This is an ongoing problem that the city will not take seriously. I called animal control and was told that there is only one animal control officer for the entire city. If this is true, what are my <strong>taxes</strong> paying for? Maybe my kids should track the dog excrement they get on their cleats though the fifth floor at city hall and then they might see what I'm going through when they get home from their games. Please ban dogs from these parks or build a fenced-in area where these dog owners can bring their dogs to relieve themselves. This is way out of hand. In Medal of Honor Park, between 4:00 and 6:00, you can't walk through the park without being accosted by dogs who's owners won't attach a leash to. Please fix this.</p>

There are several out of state vehicles that are always parked on my block.

She purchased her home approximately six yrs ago and has had issues involving <strong>taxes</strong> ever since. Per her research into the matter, she has discovered that her home's tax value (as compared to others in her surrounding area) are incorrect according to the information provided by the city by way of a model used to determine the amout to be taxed. She states that an inspector was sent and determined that the property value was greater than previously stated by city after the purchase of the home. An extra 1000 square feet were added per inspector. Owner reassures there has been no increase and or any new renovations. Permits pulled during the year were to restore property to original state when home was purchased after a flooding incident. Constituent feels as though these increases have been due to personal retaliation by the assessors department as she has been filing complaints concerning the same issue for a number of years. She has never been given an explination of charges and or the yearly increase of her property <strong>taxes</strong>. After visiting the assessors department she was told personally by staff that they are not required to provide her with any information and or explination regarding the way homes (Property Value) are taxed in her neighborhood and stated that she has to be knowlegeable of her rights as a homeowner and what her property value is as well as what she should be taxed. They refused to give her an explination about the increase of her Homes tax value and also refused to explain how these factors are determined. Constituent is requesting to speak directly to the Manager or supervisor in regards to an explination in the matter and also requesting a resolution in the matter as she has already attempted to speak to staff at city hall.</p>

This is unacceptable, as my time is more valuable than the dollar figure of the bill, and now I will have to periodically check to see when, if ever, the city is ready to take my payment. Please consider this bill paid due to the city of Boston's error.</p>

<p><em>2016-10-25 - 02127</em><br />131 West Seventh Street Unit 3 rents as an Airbnb that has parking.  This unit does not have parking! Renters constantly use private parking that belongs to other buildings.  This creates problems on the neighborhood. Why does this owner get residential exemption on <strong>taxes</strong> if she does not live there ? It is constantly rented as Airbnb. Who handles these complaints?  No contact information is available for the owner. She does not live at this property!</p>
<p><em>2016-10-23 - 02201</em><br />Resident parking:Due to the expanding neighborhood & the increase of cars & visitors (with out of state plates).   I am hopeful that the powers that be are working on a 7 days of week resident parking in all South Boston neighborhoods.  I moved to South Boston when I was 23 years old because I could afford it and I embraced the friendliness of this last neighborhood in the greater metro area.  23 years later I am still here and value what is left of this neighborhood & respect my community.  But, when I have to drive around for 20-30 minutes looking for a legal spot it infuriates me when I pass all the out of state plates taking up the much coveted parking spaces especially since I pay <strong>taxes</strong> here.Please consider the 7 days a week rule;  most if not all the neighborhoods in Boston already enforce this.  Your humble neighbor,Kelley Bowker</p>
<p><em>2016-10-21 - 02119</em><br />This car blocking my driveway today and frequently. I have spoken to driver again and again and they continue to do this and keep me from using the driveway I pay <strong>taxes</strong> on. This is unacceptable. The owner needs to be held accountable</p>
<p><em>2020-07-11 - 02119</em><br />Bag of fireworks lit from the young man killed in this building! We have to deal with their family coming where we live double park and music. Police call and we are told we are not a priority. We pay <strong>taxes</strong> and own homes. We should have peace after work.</p>

<p><em>2016-09-28 - 02150</em><br />Type of posting: Other | Exact location: 356 Bennington Street | Sponsor details: There is not evidence that show posting sing are from Department of Transportation(DT) office | Details: This current address used to have 2 signs in from of the bakery displaying a 15 min parking only. Both signs had used to have the (DT)initial at the bottom. However, this morning I was asked to move my car due to 2 sings showing a No Parking sign. First. these 2 signs are blocking about 6-7 Parkings, and the worst part is that these signs do not have the DT initial at the bottom of the signs. This bakery only operates during overnight hours and during the early morning delivering bread. Why would they need to block 6-7 parking if they don't operates as a restaurant business? In addition, if this were meant to have truck to drop off delivery product why would they to block 6-7 parking spaces. In addition why did they had their 2 cars onw by the bakery parked all across the entire parking throughout the morning. I would like this issue to be investigate it? Is illegal to have signs without having DT initial content and these 2 sign do not have it. In the past my car has been vandalize for parking in front of this bakery, do they now want all the city parking all by themselves. They are not the only ones paying for <strong>taxes</strong> in the city it's unfair. Please be aware that I will also follow up with the East Boston City Council. Thank you,</p>

<p><em>2016-09-28 - 02145</em><br />Specific location: 22 Parker St, Charlestown MA 02129 | Details: Dear Mayor Walsh, The Environmental Team and The Housing Authority, I have been a resident of the City Of Boston or the last 6 years, and am born and raised in the South Shore of Massachusetts. I have lived in Charlestown for 5 years, and back in 2014 my wife and I bought a brand new constructed townhouse on 8 Brighton Street, Charlestown. This is a 3 unit townhouse and is high end. We have been experiencing issues related to rat infestation during the last 6-7 months. We noticed rats in this neighborhood for 2 years but never on our property, The problem is a house with a large dilapidated brick building/garage behind our property behind our backyard and parking spots, The house is 22 Parker Street (Parker Street is parallel to Brighton Street). There is a gentlemen who lives alone there and people in the neighborhood have been complaining about his exterior sanitation for a while. In fact, the brick garage looks right behind our deck and kitchen. Furthermore, his yards is like a jungle and not maintained and he has a three story deck which is falling apart and has all sorts of trash and potentially hazardous materials which we have to look t every day. The whole neighborhood noticed that the rats are coming from his house and the vacant brick building He also won't allow anyone on his property and is potentially a dangerous man. If the city saw his yard they would be shocked. Im my opinion, he should wither clean up or tear down his entire property. The issue is that within our 3 units we have upped middle class families and with kids. We have a baby, and our neighbor does too. The their units has 2 kids who are older. We fear to play in the back yard or even park. Also, we couldn't even garden or grill this year because they run around. Furthermore, the other day i went take the trash out and a rat jump out and hit my leg. This is not how we should have to live. Our neighbors are having the same problem and the rest of the street and this is confirmed. The source is 22 parker street. Also the rats are on our deck which is the scariest and is a sanitation problem and how would we sell or unit? How would we rent it out? We looked online City of Boston website and saw 22 complaints of rats with his property but nothing is being done. Also, 22 parker street has taken no action and there are no audit trails. We are also noticing that the companies have been mysteriously disappearing. Is this corrupt and is 22 Parker Street paying the city off? We had numerous conversations with the City Of boston environmental team and with empty promises they said they would come out but don't see anyone or a solution. The latest excuse is that they were on vacation. We feel that the city doesn't care and expects us to live in fear with rats? We have kids what about them? We pay our <strong>taxes</strong> to this city and its not being put to use. We ere also told that the housing authority or the building code department wild come check but never did. These requests have been going on for 4-5 months by us but no action. We feel there is something isn't right and negligence. As our neighbors, we may have no choice but to escalate the matter to court or perhaps on media (channel 5) to investigate unless w get some sort of response from the city. Please note that this is very serious and this is Charlestown which is a greta place to live We shouldn't have to pay hundreds and thousand of dollars to buy a place and say <strong>taxes</strong> and get negligence from the City in return.

<p><em>2016-09-19 - 02132</em><br />I have put in many of these 311 tickets and still the issue has not been resolved. In front of my house, on the street, there is an obscene symbol.

PLEASE REMOVE this, it has been there too long and I pay my <strong>taxes</strong>, please address!!! Thank you.</p>
<p><em>2016-09-19 - 02108</em><br />The litter on the Boston Common is unbelievable. This year's hempfest was the worst ever. The park was unusable to most people the past two days and now it is a wreck. No amount of leaf blowing will pick up all the little trash in the grass. This event should move either to a hard scape like city hall plaza or to a vacant lot somewhere. To trash the center of the city is unfair to the rest of the people who actually live here and pay <strong>taxes</strong>. I hope the city has charged hempfest a lot of money to clean up the mess.</p>

The sign said resident parking but we did not realize it pointed the other way. What is that all about?? Why make that a commercial zone? These are many reasons we want to move out of Boston. We are elderly, South Boston residents(with a sticker) and we have a handicap sign. Why would the city gives a ticket?? We were in Barlow's for 1 hour only.

<p><em>2016-08-09 - 02119</em><br />Name of the Department related to the comment: Other | Comment Type: Complaint | Referred To: CONSTITUENT/24 HOUR SERVICES | Name of the employee: Alan Gentle | Describe the employee and/or their vehicle: Director of RFEC | Describe the situation: Constituent reports that he visited the Roxbury Financial Empowerment Center for the first time recently to get help filing his <strong>taxes</strong>. He previously had gone to the Cambridge Library for this, but decided to try this location. He reports that he visited here and was not given as thorough a service as he received at the Cambridge Library, so he told the Director, Alan Gentle, not to file the <strong>taxes</strong> on the constituent's behalf. Later, he found out the <strong>taxes</strong> were filed anyways and he came in to complain and seek help making amendments to the <strong>taxes</strong>, but was treated by Mr. Gentle in a "nonchalant" manner and he had to look elsewhere for help. He is complaining about the service as well as the mistakenly filed <strong>taxes</strong>.</p>

<p><em>2016-08-03 - 02102</em><br />Ok so these dancers who play their music way too loud in the back of city hall are obnoxious and rude. They expect me and my family to get off a bench because they want to hang out here smoking God knows what hanging with their "groupies". I work near city hall and I think their music is way too loud. I want to open my window while I am working and need to listen to there disgusting music. Do they need a permit to dance at Faneuil Hall because they are disturbing the peace and do they pay <strong>taxes</strong> on all the tips they make. ??</p>
<p><em>2016-08-02 - 00000</em><br />SR Type: GROUND MAINTENANCE | Description of the problem: This is a request for the M Street Park. This park is in the heart of a very family oriented neighborhood and is severely neglected....almost to the point where it's unsafe to play sports on. This park get's a ton of usage but appears to receive zero maintenance. We pay a lot to live where we do and even more in <strong>taxes</strong> to the city. Softball playoffs continue tonight and we'd greatly appreciate the city do the bare minimum to ensure the fields are playable after a rainy morning. Neglecting a field that the community relies on is extremely disappointing. Why are the other parks around the city taken care of but ours aren't? This sets a bad precedent.</p>
<p><em>2017-05-22 - 02150</em><br />Reopening this until the city does something about the residents at 196 blocking off spots with space savers all weekend long. Just because they are gone when you finally check this Monday morning does not mean it is not an ongoing problem for residents in the area, and just closing these tickets is a slap in the face to those who complain without any help at all from the city. Two residents in the immediate vicinity have sold in the past year due to the noise and harassment. It is not fair to people who actually live and pay <strong>taxes</strong> in the city to not have parking, or have dozens of motorcycles blocking the street, and revving engines and setting off car alarms until 3 and 4am on weekends. The police do nothing when there are a crowd of 50 people just gathered on the sidewalk. No doubt if they were Latino or black this would end up with many arrests, but a white criminal gang gets a free pass. Please step up the surveillance of the area to stop the Outlaws, the white MS13.</p>

<p><em>2017-05-15 - 02210</em><br />Specific location: 190-210 Pier 4 Blvd, Boston MA 02210 | Details: Noise complaint. Tishman ad Speyer constantly violate noise ordinances for the city during week days by working past 6pm. They stated that they will work until 10pm at night and it is now 10:41pm and they are still working and causing noise on Tuesday, May 2, 2017. I feel this is appalling that he city would allow this to happen on week nights when people who pay <strong>taxes</strong> have to go to work in order to support those <strong>taxes</strong> for the city. I feel that the noise ordinances should be followed by these developers and not disturb the hard working residents of Boston. These developers should not work past 6pm on weekdays, before 7am on weekdays, or on Sundays at all. This has been such a nuisance and no amount of meetings or discussions with them has rectified this situation. The city needs to take action and enforce the ordinances and not grant permits to annoy and hugely inconvenience their tax paying citizens.</p>

It's not fair to real hotels and also we have no way of knowing who is coming and going. We had drug dealers and now after the double murder something needs to be done, there is no security that normal apts have. Samuelson doesn't care Do they pay hotel <strong>taxes</strong>? It's not fair to hotels and hotel workers.</p>

There are two outside tables that extend in front of the alley fence which is for all U Park residents on the off side of the street.

<p><em>2017-03-14 - 02132</em><br />Description: The snow plows have been down Myles Standish Road twice since the start of the storm but have only plowed on the odd side of the street to the curb. That leaves the even side of the street 8 feet from the plowed area! There is only 1 car parked on the even side of the street at #8. There is no reason the plows can't plow to the curb on the even side of the street as well as the odd side. That is the law! I pay <strong>taxes</strong> too!</p>

Because Canterbury Place apartments does not have enough parking for their residents, and they charge a monthly fee to use the parking garage, residents, and guests park on Navarre St, Clare Ave, and surrounding streets without regard for residents who do not have driveways and need to park. Both Navarre and Clare Ave are two way streets, but with cars on both sides, the streets are impossible to navigate. And when approached, they are often rude, and we have several elderly in the area that have lived here all their lives. How do we as property owners who pay <strong>taxes</strong>, protect on street parking? As a neighborhood are there options for us to consider to curb parking by guests, and visitors to the building? Are there options for overnight resident parking, say from 6pm-6am, we could explore?"</p>

The even side of the street is not plowed and we are 11-12 feet from the plowed side. I pay <strong>taxes</strong> here too and I want my side plowed.

<p><em>2017-02-02 - 02130</em><br />Is this a delivery too? I swear. City of Boston: the City where you can do anything you want if you have a hard hat. But if you live here, you'll get a ticket for just about anything and don't expect the City to bother sweeping your streets or any other basic services despite the <strong>taxes</strong> you pay.</p>

She didn't, and just called again to say that it still has not been picked up. I asked her if she called back later that night to put in the report and she said that she shouldn't have to. I nicely explained the policy and said I could put it in the system but couldn't promise anything and she said that she won't pay her <strong>taxes</strong> and hung up on me. I am still putting in the missed report but since she hung up on me, I don't have any contact information.</p>
<p><em>2017-09-27 - 02120</em><br />I submitted a request this morning for trash pick up because it did not get picked up yesterday (9/26/17) and the recycle bin was not  completely emptied. This is not the first time our trash has been ignored at 1 Elmwood St, my last request was 9/6/17. I just arrived home to find a violation notice saying the barrels were left out after pickup. This is not our fault, we pay <strong>taxes</strong> and get ignored anyway.</p>

<p><em>2017-09-24 - 02127</em><br />Every Sunday night there is loud Latin music playing with a dj starting around  9pm, the noise bounces off the buildings but seem to be come from the West 9th street or Old Colony locations, could also be from either projects.  The south Boston police department does not answer their phone and there are never any police cars patrolling this area.  I can't be the only person complaining about this, I'm not comfortable walking around the dark neighborhoods looking for this rave, based on the noise it would not be hard to find.  Do I need to call 911 for help?  I pay enough in <strong>taxes</strong> the least you can do is close down these parties so I can get to work in the am!!</p>
<p><em>2017-09-22 - 02114</em><br />Contractors pick up trucks and vehicles who are working at Mount Vernon St. and at Temple Place continue to park illegally in and no parking fire zone tow zone .  We have neighbors viewing the street regularly and witnessed a city official looking at the license plates and not take it in the trucks that were parked there illegally. Clearly there is something not right. The city is getting kickbacks or otherwise encouraging illegal behavior. It's pretty clear that ticketing is a disincentive to illegal parking. There is not a resident that could park out on the street for a few minutes without being ticketed. These people are not allowed to park there they do not pay Boston <strong>taxes</strong> they are not residents and they are clearly getting some favorable privilege from the city of Boston and it is documented and on camera. It's time to shape up and and abide by the law. It be wonderful if residence could just park out there without issue but guess what we get ticketed no matter what. There is clearly kick back operation going on here</p>

<p><em>2017-07-22 - 02107</em><br />When will the City Hall take ownership of the drug problem that has made its way to Moakley Park? It's quickly becoming Tent City there. Needles are being found on a regular basis. Junkies and bums are making a mess of the porta-potties. Human feces is found in various areas of the park. The junkies are intimidating people with their arguing and loud junkie talk. Kids are distracted from their baseball games by maggots shouting at the kids from the bleachers while the game is going on. The fields need to be searched for heroin needles before each game. Needles are frequently found under the player's benches. It's beginning to become a situation where the parents watching their kids play aren't going to stand for it. These dirty people are causing problems for the law abiding people just trying to enjoy the park that they pay <strong>taxes</strong> to be maintained. The park and the peaceful atmosphere it is supposed to provide is being ruined by the scumbags who don't pay any <strong>taxes</strong> for anything. As a taxpayer I demand this problem is addressed immediately.</p>

Do something about it. Thank you.</p>
<p><em>2017-07-16 - 02127</em><br />you've removed my request to clean up after a very disgusting nasty person who has taken to living on the sidewalk and surround king himself with his own filth - these stupid people are giving him money to support his habits instead of helping him to use the resources that all of our <strong>taxes</strong> pay for, they are encouraging him to stay on the street- i don't like to have to smell him or step over him - no i'm not an uncaring person, i see too much of this every day and am sick of it</p>
<p><em>2017-07-14 - 02132</em><br />Request Type: Other | Details: Very narrow, heavily populated area with limited street parking. Man at 95 Sanborn demands that no one park in front of his house (he has a driveway and doesn't use the space for his own cars. He just doesn't want anyone parking in front of his house). Every Thursday afternoon he spreads his trashcans in out over 20-30 feet in the street to ensure no access for street parking. Says that since he pays <strong>taxes</strong>, he owns the street. Makes it very difficult for residents who rely on street parking availability.</p>

<p><em>2017-07-04 - 02121</em><br />Rats running down the street daily. Why pay <strong>taxes</strong> when the city doesn't care about this neighborhood! Nothing is being done to help this problem. Everyone has trash lids on their trash cans, so it's not the people  that's the problem it's the city responsibility to the people to bait the sewers to stop the problem! Oh wait I forgot this is Dorchester... what was I thinking! this isn't the back bay.</p>
<p><em>2017-07-04 - 02132</em><br />The house beside me is a disgrace. I have filed reports before and have been told citations have been issued but nothing has changed. The backyard looks like a dump and the weeds are 3 feet high with growth everywhere including growing into my yard. There are bugs, rodents and other animals in there. This has been going on for over a year. They bought the house and started renovations last year but I have no clue what is going on there. Clearly the occasional citations are not motivating them to clean it up. I should not have to deal with this. I do not pay the high <strong>taxes</strong> and mortgage I pay to live next to this. Something needs to be done.</p>

"After various attempts to get our Recycle picked up after the driver skipped our stop on 5/18/2017, Driver claims that the street was blocked in which it was not, the street that was blocked was the alley from Sleeper street where he does a pick up before our stop until Farnsworth street, the alley from Farnsworth street to Thompson Place which is our alley was open and used as a detour everyday since the Development of 10 Farnsworth street has been in progress, So I don't understand why our stop was missed, 5/18/2017 3:30pm reported to DPW that it was not picked up was told to report on 5/19 if it was still there in the morning, reported on 5/19, re-called DPW and Capitol Waste was told by Capitol Waste that all trucks left the area 5/19 at 2pm, at 3pm Boston Inspectional services was on site surveying our recycle explained to him that our stop was missed he said he would report to loui Supervisor at Capitol waste to have the recycle picked up for Monday, Monday at 9am I called Capitol to confirm for pick as I was told After speaking with the Customer service rep at Capitol Waste she said she would confirm with Loui the supervisor, I received a call back from Capitol stating that they are aware and that they would try to pick it today if not it will be picked on the regular scheduled day which is Thursday, I expressed that this was not acceptable to our community because the Driver was negligent in skipping our stop when our recycle has been out since Wednesday night for Thursday pick, I would like to escalate this complaint for service to be provided to the property in which is being paid for thru property <strong>taxes</strong>. it is 100 unit residential complex, I no longer have the means or containers to collect the recycle to comply with the city ordinance due to the recycle containers being full and not collected by the DPW and City Of Boston trash/recycle contractor Capitol Waste,They should be held to the standards of the City of Boston inspectional services when they requested for service to be provided for the pick up and the contractor Capitol Waste refuses to do so when it was requested only to be told that it may have to wait another week for pick up for their negligence in service. this should not be acceptable to the city of Boston or it's resident paying for a service that is not being rendered in good faith."</p>

<p><em>2018-01-04 - 02132</em><br />Description: The snow plow just came by to plow Myles Standish Road West Roxbury(7:32 PM). As usual, the plow did not plow the even side of the street, even though the cars are off the street and in driveways. It is 4 feet from the plowed area to the curb on the even side of the street. My husband is retired with a heart condition and I just had shoulder surgery. We cannot dig out 4 feet from the curb! We pay <strong>taxes</strong> too! Plow the even side of Myles Standish Road!</p>
<p><em>2018-01-04 - 02135</em><br />Car parked on sidewalk with New York plates.  On the street with 3 schools and thickly settled prone to accidents     If we pay Boston <strong>taxes</strong> and can't park on the street this car shouldn't be either.    This was parked her overnight and there's no parking at that part of the street ever.   This could pose a problem for emergency aparatus as well</p>
<p><em>2018-01-03 - 02201</em><br />I've an idea. Before the storm hits, why doesn't the city tow all the non-residents parkers so that the residents have a place to park, ya know the people who actually pay excise and property <strong>taxes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>2018-01-03 - 02129</em><br />I called about xmas trees not being picked up earlier today. It appears that they came back and picked up the majority but missed two more at this address.   Now about your 311 operators  I called once and we got disconnected I called again and the person barley listened to me and transferred me to a department that was already closed and I was re routed back into the 311 queue to wait Again and this guy told me to wait to 6pm go back out into the cold again and if they were still there to call 311 back to tell them.   I pay my <strong>taxes</strong> and it's not my job to check on the situation and call you back to tell you if your contractor isn't doing thief job.  What can't you log the call and send someone out to do what we pay you to do right the first time.   Ridiculous</p>

<p><em>2017-12-21 - 02130</em><br />Our names are Erica and Michael Lewy. We are BPS parents who live in Jamaica Plain, with our child Hazel Lewy, who attends the BTU Pilot School in the 4th Grade. She's been a student there since K1, and we would hate to leave the amazing community of families, administrators and teachers we've connected with over the years.The new 9:30 a.m. start and 4:00 p.m. end time at my school will not work for our family. Aside from the fact that a 9:30 start leaves us with nothing to do with our daughter in the morning between the hours of 7:30-9:30 a.m. (current bus pickup time) as both parents in our household work, we have developed a rich after school enrichment program schedule that balances out our child's life. She takes theater classes that start at 3:34 with children from all over the area. This cannot be replaced by any on-site programming. Neither of us are able, or willing to remove her early from school classes  early to make it to her theater classes (nor would I hope BPS would want us to) in time to make it for their start. She attends Karate at 4:15 - while this is after 4pm,  there is no way her school bus would be able to get her from school to the site in time. She also attends Kids Arts in Jamaica Plain, which offers a robust variety of activities, such as music, dance, fine arts, cooking, outdoor time, theater and much more. Busing can often take 45 minutes or more from the BTU school to her site and 4pm is a heavy traffic period, especially in the area of the BTU school. She will not reach her destination site until 4:3-5pm which cuts out all of the homework time and most of the free play/outdoor time at Kids Arts and cuts into the enrichment activities that I mentioned above.A child's life is not just schooling. It should not be sitting on buses going from here to there. It should not be inadequate on-site school activities (which has been my experience with on-site care, which honestly is all it is) meant to pass the time in the morning because public school systems are trying to save money.The BTU Pilot School currently starts at 8:30 am and I see no reason to change it's start time. It falls perfectly in line with research, scheduling and what BPS itself is saying it wants for schools. Why mess with a good thing? We understand the intention of later start times for high school students, and the research youve used, but not at the expense of our younger students.The reality is BPS will be spending money, solving the problems that have been just created, to cover the cost of before and after care. If schools need more money, let's fight to have private schools pay for their own buses, raise <strong>taxes</strong> so schools can afford what they need, fight the charters, look to other cities as models (grants such as Seattle, special city buses just for students, school buses that drop off students to more than one school). Stop messing around with our kid's scheduling, stop making up excuses and playing around with algorithms to make things appear scientific. Let's be real. These are kids and families. There are real people involved here. Number crunching isn't going to solve the problems of BPS. If BPS need cash, it needs to be generated. It may be hard but it's not harder than messing around with our families. We strongly urge you to halt these proposed start and end times until you have gotten far more feedback on the impacts that such drastic changes will have on the children and families here. We intend to continue working together with Boston Public School parents, administrators and teachers until our voices are heard. Families will not back down!Thank you, The Lewy FamilyErica, Michael and Hazel (age 9 who is so upset already about the possibility of missing out next year on her after school activities)BTU Pilot School Family</p>

<p><em>2017-12-06 - 02136</em><br />Today is trash day and my recycling bin was left untouched at the side walk, this is not the first time this is happening.

I would like to know Why?</p>
<p><em>2017-12-05 - 02114</em><br />This truck has been parked illegally since 6:46AM - why hasn't it been towed?! It is blocking critical access to front door entrance for a mother with two infants in the stroller the sidewalk is narrow it's not possible to negotiate without being able to briefly cross into the street. This is incredible if it were a resident the city would've told him hours ago but you continue to give these contractors who do not pay Boston city <strong>taxes</strong> as well complete free range. Not only is this illegal and Flagrant abuse - but the city continues to encourage by not enforcing this is a safety hazard and will only become worse unless the city Decides to actually enforce the same way they would residence that would mean ticket and tow ticket and tow.</p>

<p><em>2017-11-20 - 02127</em><br />Out of state parking why am I paying real estate and excise <strong>taxes</strong> when I can not park near my house this truck has been here since friday</p>
<p><em>2017-11-18 - 01210</em><br />So let me get this straight. BTD elects not to enforce parking laws in my neighborhood on certain days, and when I report issues, its MY job to call THE POLICE? Why? So they can not send anyone because they're busy, you know, responding to crimes being committed? Who is responsible for answering BTD's 311 cases?

Cyclist Policy | Comments on the Policy or Program: Constituent called to comment on cyclists in the city. He has noticed a dramatic increase in the number of bikes on the road and has found this to be dangerous for other drivers. Constituent notes they weave in and out of lanes, and hit vehicles without stopping. Constituent thinks they should be required to be insured, have a license plate, and pay extra <strong>taxes</strong> to help fund the bike lanes. Constituent is able to provide more information via email if the policy office reaches out.</p>
<p><em>2017-11-13 - 02116</em><br />Details: I'm quite sure you have a file on the residential construction at 40 Clarendon Street but as a neighbor, I want to express my deepening concern about this project which began as replacement facade (initially without permits) and has progressed to a dangerous gutting of the building's lower infrastructure that threatens the abutter's residences and the stability of the block in general. The construction which began 2 years ago has once again stalled leaving a boarded up facade in front of a deep and dangerous dug-out pit. The neighbors have filed countless complaints about this project to no avail. We pay very high <strong>taxes</strong> in this area and it's extremely frustrating to find that the city has little or no interest or ability to help us. Please advise where we can direct our concerns.</p>
<p><em>2017-11-11 - 02210</em><br />Did BPD get the entire weekend off ?? Absolutely no enforcement of resident parking over the last couple of days.

The roads have become a disaster with potholes and damages which are even more obvious during inclement weather Here we have some basing questions. What happened to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), that supposedely cares for the beautification of the neighborhood and the shape of buiding. Whatever happened to the environmentalist movement that ,you, the city of Bostom claim to be so concerned about?, It is evident that those constructions are only for the benefit of the contractors and the city of Boston, (money, money, money,) without any consideration for the citizens who pay <strong>taxes</strong> to preserve the quality of life of the neighborhood.

<p><em>2018-03-27 - 02124</em><br />How is this acceptable?!?! We are living in a dumpster! I have reached out to you for two years now and nothing has changed... if the owner isn't cleaning the sidewalk, you as a city should clean it!!! We pay our <strong>taxes</strong>.. if nothing changes, I'm calling the Mayer's office and I have proof of all the times I have reached out to you.</p>
<p><em>2018-03-18 - 02116</em><br />There are signs posted about loitering after hours.  As a significant tax payer, why do you not give these people a place to go?  I am confronted with people dealing 24/7.  My dog was barking Sunday morning when my daughter was catching a Lyft to go to the airport, and again, I see a person getting into a car that looters on Newbury at 4:00a'm.   It leaves after letting the person that got into the passenger seat before my daughter gets into her LYFT at 5:20.  What is happening?  You tell me.  The corner of Dartmouth, Newbury, & Boylston is a constant flow of drug trafficking.  It is a public school site.  It is a tourist site.  It is ignored by all else.  Given the property <strong>taxes</strong> I pay that have never been redemptive in education, I think that the City of Boston owes me a dog walk that doesn't make me afraid for personal safety, I didn't ask them for Children's education.</p>
<p><em>2018-03-17 - 02210</em><br />And now we have the drunken howling. Is the city going to send someone to shit it down or will we listen to this all night? This is a PROBLEM PROPERTY. When I paid the surcharge on my property <strong>taxes</strong>, I thought it meant I'd be getting a better level of service.</p>

Please plow the even side of the street!</p>
<p><em>2018-03-13 - 02126</em><br />Why is it every time it snows heavily we have this issue with snow removal? You don't clean the street thoroughly. If I go to other neighborhoods like South Boston this is not an issue. Do we not pay our <strong>taxes</strong> like everyone else? Again you need to widen the street, this is why we remove the cars off the street. Need I remind you that we have a number of elderly and physically challenged residents. What is so difficult about going down one side of the street and coming up? Instead of going up and down the street the same way. When Menino was in office we didn't have this problem, so why has it become one now! What do I need to do in order to ensure this does not keep happening? Do we need handicap signs placed up and down the street? Please advise.</p>
<p><em>2018-03-13 - 02138</em><br />Description: As usual, the plows do NOT plow all the way to the top of the street (hill top). It is NOT plowed in front of my house as a result.

<p><em>2018-02-20 - 02136</em><br />Picture is from 10 Danny Rd. Damage lawn due to plow service from last snow storm.  Constant issue.  Additional photos to follow.  Major problem is that we have no side walks, due to the city labeling the street as a private way.  We pay <strong>taxes</strong> last time I checked, and get no road repairs.  This picture was taken today after all the snow melted.  Absolutely was caused by the plow, due to the fact we have no side walk for the plows to guide themselves.</p>

We pay enough property <strong>taxes</strong> and all we get is trash removal and snow plowing and they are both done poorly. Often after trash and recycle has been picked up. The debris that they leave behind is not call for. I am going to start taking pictures of how they leave some of the areas on the St. You drop it pick it up.

<p><em>2018-01-16 - 02150</em><br />Request type: Other | Details: I live at # 169 which abuts #167. The property , 167 Coleridge street, has been vacant for over twenty years. Prior to tbis, there was a fire at the property during the late 1970's. The house was never fully renovated or repaired and fire damaged wood is still in the house and is visible. It has been rotting away, debris falling and flying all over the place. In November I fell down the flight of back stairs after slipping on a piece of the roofing that I did not see on my step. I fell and busted my legs, a broken knee with lower leg damage/bruising, right multi-tiered ligament and tendon damage, back injury, both wrists, right shoulder and 2 chipped front teeth and a body full of bruises with loads of pain. I spent many weeks in a rehab/ skilled nursing facility and now receive home based care/services . Now, as the property sits and awaits the approval of building permits, it continues to fall apart..and is very close to collapse. Someone is going to get killed. This needs to be addressed IMMEDIATELY. the rear of the 2nd floor already collapsed, someone was already seriously injured...when will you address this issue?? I personally have called at least 10 times to report unsafe condition of the property and I know.that others have called as well. The inspector that came to check on the 'overgrown grass' was not concerned with the house itself as the owner "pays his <strong>taxes</strong> so there isn't anything else he is worried about". I have many photos but no one seems concerned. Please do something. I was hurt badly and am grateful that it wasn't my children! | Exact location: Front, rear, roof, sides, porches (first & second floors)</p>
<p><em>2018-01-16 - 02128</em><br />All the <strong>taxes</strong> we pay there's nobody to clean up this mess it's all of East Boston the city looks like a dump</p>
<p><em>2018-01-14 - 02210</em><br />Another long weekend with no enforcement of resident parking in city point. The city has no problem increasing property <strong>taxes</strong> but forgoes the revenue that could be made by actually ticketing violators actually</p>
<p><em>2018-01-11 - 02127</em><br />Tell Marty Walsh to ban space savers forever!!! New York doesnt allow this practiceFurthermore tell him to drive around South Boston to see all the space savers the lazy ass Dow people threw up there.Our <strong>taxes</strong> should not have one penny put toward talking about or cleaning up space saver trashThe policy should be banned immediately. People have abused it and now they have ruined it for everybody.Who is going to clean up the debris left in the middle of the road because somebody ?</p>
<p><em>2018-01-10 - 02135</em><br />Day #7 illegally parked isn't this considered abandoned?   I can't believe that somebody with an out of state plate gets accommodations like this.   I pay <strong>taxes</strong> in the city and state and Massachusetts car insurance and adhere to the rules of parking this car should not be treated differently</p>
<p><em>2018-01-10 - 02128</em><br />Entitled idiots still have space savers everywhere on Sumner street and the city does nothing.. Remind me what I pay <strong>taxes</strong> for again?</p>
<p><em>2018-01-09 - 02201</em><br />Called yesterday and they said 24 hours . The city has not picked up trash since last monday jan1. There is a street with over 100 trash bags some opened some good . Rats running around . I can't get anyone to respond . it's insane that the city hasn't come after 8 days snow or. o snow everyone else got it picked up twice since then . Address is 5 Baldwin place and 7 baldwin place boston ma 02113 . <strong>taxes</strong> go up but shit is done.  Hope this isn't more wasted time</p>
<p><em>2018-01-09 - 01125</em><br />Sidewalk not shoveled. The address is 7 Burrell NOT 9. Do not ticket 9 Burrell. Lot owned by Loews family. There mailing  Address is in Milton, Ma. They pay <strong>taxes</strong> for it so they should shovel it/</p>
<p><em>2018-01-09 - 02135</em><br />This car has been there for 6 days.  I get it not being towed but not even a parking ticket all people should be held to same rules.   I can't park on the street and I'm paying Boston <strong>taxes</strong></p>
<p><em>2020-07-05 - 02121</em><br />Why is 911 busy?!!!! My house is shaking!!!! Household with baby cannot sleep. WTF. I pay too much in <strong>taxes</strong>, property excise etc for this BS. These are bombs going off. Can Marty and Commissioner Gross hear these too?!!!!  So better!</p>
<p><em>2018-01-08 - 02127</em><br />As I walk around south Boston 95% of all handicap ramps have high mounts of snow. The city of boston should be ashamed of them selfs. As all of the mounts of snow is from the plow trucks. It's a safety issue. I'm glad our <strong>taxes</strong> dollars paid for a shitty snow removal job. Smh</p>
<p><em>2018-01-08 - 02201</em><br />You all treat Dorchester like it's garbage. Even though it's now barely afforafable, you still prioritize back bay and the south end and beacon hill. The growth in Dorchester and the amount of property <strong>taxes</strong> paid just put us in the same tier. Stop screwing over Dorchester just because it's mainly non-white. 311 reports In Dorchester are constantly put at the bottom of the list. This city is all silos, and not every neighborhood is treated the same. Ugh</p>
<p><em>2018-01-08 - 02115</em><br />Description: The parking lane for cars on the even side of Westland is still filled with snow. At least 20 spots are NOT available. It was very thoughtful of the city to plow the Bike Lanes down to the pavement so that the hundreds of people riding bikes during the Arctic Freeze could navigate quickly. It would have even more thoughtful if the city had given the same consideration to car owners who pay Excise Taxes every year.</p>
<p><em>2018-01-08 - 02108</em><br />Street not plowed - cars can't park- cars blocking my entrance to garage because they are so far off the curb- thisnis totally unacceptable for the amount I pay in <strong>taxes</strong></p>
<p><em>2018-01-08 - 02126</em><br />The whole street hasn't been plowed. Difficult for small cars to drive on the street. This street never gets plowed & the property <strong>taxes</strong> are so high.</p>
<p><em>2018-01-08 - 02118</em><br />Snow removal.  All of blackstone square and around the park needs to be cleared as well as on Washington street sidewalks between newton and Rutland the city should fire whoever is in charge of these sidewalks. Not one year have these been cleared to city code.  It's absurd for s city that is use to snow and how much we pay in <strong>taxes</strong> to live here. Also Worcester square street needs cleared....the intersection at Worcester square Ana's Washington is a joke and dangerous...the its a two way street and the entry has only been cleared as a one way.  Dangerous to traffics and pedestrians.</p>
<p><em>2018-01-06 - 02212</em><br />No snow plow since first snow fall this happens every year!! Everyone on this street pay their share of state <strong>taxes</strong> yet we have to suffer every winter !!! This is absolutely unacceptable from the city of Boston!</p>
<p><em>2018-01-06 - 02127</em><br />L street reduced to one lane due to poor plowing. Cars can't get by each other it's only a matter of time. Before someone gets hurt by a frustrated driver. If you're going ban parking you should do your jobs and open the roadway to the curb  on both sides The side streets are a mess with people piling snow in the streets and narrowing them to one lane as well   What a poor job on theFirst storm of the winter by the city great use of property <strong>taxes</strong></p>

Visitor Parking | Comments on the Policy or Program: Having just paid you $246.00 I feel obligated to speak my mind and I am sure the mind of others in Boston. It is absolutely RIDICULOUS that I and many others cant visit friends or family without getting tickets. I mean really? No visitor passes at all? Its bad enough you are dictating in some areas of the city that we can visit for 2 hours only or in increments. Again, REALLY? Who exactly made up this monstrosity of a plan? Paying <strong>taxes</strong> isn't enough? Who exactly can I complain to more or try to get this changed?</p>
<p><em>2018-08-06 - 02113</em><br />Human feces in alley behind Cutillo Park on Morton St, trash everywhere, empty bottles,  stolen merchandise cases.

<p><em>2018-08-03 - 02201</em><br />Name of the Department related to the comment: Other | Comment Type: Complaint | Referred To: TAX: COLLECTING | What policy/program is your comment related to? Motor Vehicle Excise Tax Abatement | Comments on the Policy or Program: Thank you for coordinating what must be complicated logistics for assessing motor <strong>taxes</strong> and abatement in the city. Our family is fortunate to have a car in the city for work and travel. I want to just document a complaint about the frustrating process required to go through motor tax abatement from the viewpoint of the taxpayer. First, the instructions on the back of the tax notice are vague, and seem to indicate you need to retrieve and submit your old license plates. I finally realized I just needed to find the email I received confirming I was cancelling registration, but this was not clear. Instructions about dealing with abatement are not on the same RMV webpage for cancelling registration, so I had to refer to multiple websites and retrospectively gather these documents, including bill of sale. In the interim there was a "Demand" tax. Then the abatement was processed (Bill 9659), with a Tax Balance. I received this two weeks ago because our family was away on vacation. A highlighted section indicated I needed to call to determine further charges, but did not provide any explanation or a due date. In a short interval I received a Warrant, and further charges (Warrant, Warrant Notice, Interest, Fees) with warnings that I would be served this personally or where I work and that my license would be nonrenewable, and with a due date of 8/20/18. I appreciate it must be hard to collect <strong>taxes</strong>. This process, though, seems suboptimal. Information is lacking or directions are confusing on mailed materials, due dates and late fees are not clearly explained, and after 4 months of sorting this out I am abruptly served a "Warrant" with unnecessarily threatening language. I have paid the full amount, to divorce myself from this process, but I sincerely hope you review your methods and mailing materials to improve this process for other taxpayers. Maybe include a pamphlet or a direct website link to the process with all of the due dates, late fees, documents, and help desk numbers on ones site.</p>

Thank you for the organized list and information. I am wondering why students who are Boston residents but attend schools outside of Boston are not eligible for several of these scholarships. They and their parents are tax payers to the Boston <strong>taxes</strong> so it seems completely exclusionary and inequitable to these students. Please let me know if the policies of these scholarships will consider Boston residents attending schools in other towns. Thank you!"</p>
<p><em>2018-08-02 - 01210</em><br />This 21 Newhall st , with dead Squirrel in back yard , which I pay Taxes on , so how about you come pick it up and Dispose of it ?</p>
<p><em>2018-08-01 - 02128</em><br />Very loud construction work being performed right now (7:45pm) by East Boston's most-popular uninsured, unlicensed wannabe contractor, Everaldo Barbosa of Everaldo Construction Inc. It's simply not fair that legitimate contractors have to pay fees for permits, carry insurance, pay <strong>taxes</strong> on income, and work within certain hours, while Everaldo cruises along on a daily basis without any regulation...not to mention how unfair it is that none of these renovations are being picked up by the assessing department, which means that the law-abiding citizen who pulls permits picks up a larger portion of the tax burden while the Who-cares-because-Boston-doesnt-enforce-anything landlord gets to experience no increase in assessed value. Seems simple: The guy has an LLC, he has a van with the company logo, so take a look online--no HIC license, no record of insurance, not a single permit ever applied for in the City of Boston...</p>
<p><em>2018-08-01 - 02201</em><br />Case (SR) Type: Miscellaneous | Referred To: Boston 311 | Description: Comment from constituent regarding paying excise tax, please follow-up: "I just had a heck of a time trying to get some answers about handling of excise tax payments and contact information. I bought a new car in July 2017, moved from one area of Brighton to another in December of 2017. I received my prorated 2017 excise tax bill at my new address but never received my 2018 excise tax bill. However, the collection agency, Kelly & Ryan, apparently has my correct address and I received a notice of a warrant for collection of <strong>taxes</strong> for my 2018 excise tax bill that i never received. Both the people at kelly/ryan and the city of Boston said there's nothing we can do about it and i'm stuck paying the extra $30 in fees. After relenting and expressing my concerns about the fairness of the situation i asked how we could remedy the problem so that it doesn't happen again. To which everyone i spoke with said there was nothing they could do, that January 1st, the RMV updates the City with addresses. After hearing this I asked for clarification, that any correspondence from the city of Boston would be sent to my old address until January 2019, to which i was assured that would be the case and there is no way to fix that but i should check in with the RMV to make sure they have my current address. This all seems to be an absolutely crazy levels of bureaucracy and gives the impression that the city is out to screw over its people for a few dollars. I'd love to find out why these systems seem so antiquated, why it is so difficult to update an address with the city of Boston and if there is anyway to recoup the $30 in fees i just paid. I look forward to hearing form someone about this."</p>

Have called the Medford police numerous times to complain, many times they tell me its a DCR road so the state police are the people who need to handle this, or to call animal control (which isnt open at 2 am on a Saturday morning), or they drive by 45 min later after the dog has already been taken inside. I didnt realize that living on Highland Ave means that we arent allotted the same services that other Medford residents are allotted; Our <strong>taxes</strong> clearly go elsewhere.

<p><em>2018-06-29 - 02132</em><br />What is the intended occupancy: Residential | What is illegal about current use: Commercial | Which unit is illegal: The entire second floor of building | How many mailboxes: Supposed to be 4 residential units | Details: I wanted to bring to your attention an illegal use in West Roxbury located on 1952 Centre Street which affects <strong>taxes</strong> and the neighborhood. The second floor above the toy store of this property is currently being used as a kids violin studio and a kids art studio. Both of which have been in existence since the 1980s. There are two commercial tenants on this floor. The second floor has residential occupancy, not commercial. Only the first floor is permitted for commercial use in this building. I have attached a floor plan of existing use that was submitted to the city as the second floor plan claiming it was a residential floor. With that being said, this building has been evading commercial <strong>taxes</strong> on the second floor since the 1980s. Here are each of their websites: http://www.suzukiboston.com https://m.facebook.com/Noahsartwestroxbury/ This building poses fire hazard threats due to lack of proper fire escape access. Plus the building is in absolute disrepair with clapboard falling off the exterior. I have attached photos for your reference. It is unfair when citizens work their heart out to pay their <strong>taxes</strong> and do the right thing. Meanwhile, there are citizens like this who evade <strong>taxes</strong> and break laws with any regard. Not to mention that having young children on the second floor of this building is a serious hazard and should not be taken lightly. I would like to see action being taken on this property and bring justice to the neighborhood. Thank you.</p>

He never returns any phone calls so she spoke to his supervisor Michael Hutchenson and she got a call that the matter was resolved that very day. Michael followed up with her and said that it had been paid off, however, she saw that she still owed money and that the credit does not seem to have been applied. She addressed the issue about the interst and fees she's been charged due to Michael's delay, and he told her that she is still liable for them. The city has been collecting interest due to this problem, and the matter could have been handled a lot easier. Her time and money could have been spared. She is still concerned if she's still paying the fees and would like someone to follow up with her.</p>

Property <strong>taxes</strong> | Comments on the Policy or Program: A walk in came into 311 to express his frustration with some of the systems collecting uses. He said that the property tax collection department cannot be contacted directly. the automated voice message prompt requires the caller to use a by name directory when nobody answers. I, as a caller am unfamiliar with the names of employees in the department. Furthermore an operator is never available to assist. When using the website to search for my invoice, I encountered a lot of difficulty with the system I tried inputting all the required information and nothing would generate. I origrinally brought up this issue with the collecting window back in february, but the teller promptly turned me away saying they don't know how to use that system. the system only worked when I used just my ward and parcel number. Please look into changing these features, to make the system more user friendly. Thank you for your attention to this issue.</p>
<p><em>2018-05-14 - 01125</em><br />The park at 1187 Columbia rd south Boston. My son attends the Ollie and fell through a red ladder at the playground. The ladder once had capped bolts that aren't on there anymore. He fell through climbing up the ladder and fell back and got a small laceration on his head. He needed a staple. I would really appreciate someone attending to this matter ASAP! We pay high <strong>taxes</strong> and a lot for school . Our children should be safe. Playgrounds should be safe for children. The school is also contacting you I have doctors reports and an incident report from school. I guess this isn't the first incident with these bolts on the red ladder in the park.</p>

<p><em>2019-01-29 - 02201</em><br />Name of the Department related to the comment: PublicWorks | Comment Type: Complaint | What policy/program is your comment related to? Hazardout waste pickup program | Comments on the Policy or Program: Consituent believes that it is unreasonable that residents of the city can only drop off hazardous waste during four days of the year exclusively in the summer. Wants to know what her 85 year old father can do when he is moving before the closest hazardous waste pickup day. Wants to know what <strong>taxes</strong> are being paid for. Wonders why her tax dollars wont pay for year-round hazardous waste deposit after paying <strong>taxes</strong> for her whole life, yet the illegal immigrants living in the sanctuary city of Boston do not pay <strong>taxes</strong> and have every service at their disposal. And nobody asked the constituent if she agreed with Boston being a sanctuary city.</p>

I think the taxpayers deserve an answer because this has been going on far too long.  That employee better stop, we pay far too high of <strong>taxes</strong> for this nonsense.

Who takes care of this school - BPW or a custodian? Someone is clearly not doing their job. So sad that little kids have to go to a public school that has trash littered all over the property. What are we teaching them? Or where are the <strong>taxes</strong> going if we aren't better our schools and kids? Marty Walsh should come back to DOT and take a look around his public schools, especially this one, and see if he approves. So sad.</p>

<p><em>2018-11-28 - 02131</em><br />Can we have a barrel installed at the corner of Mount Hope Avenue and Hyde Park Avenue at the bus stop in front of the store fronts in Roslindale so people will have a place to put their trash rather than on the ground. I believe that we pay enough residential <strong>taxes</strong> in order to get a barrel installed if you notice that the two corners to the left and the right of this corner have barrels and there is not trash and debris on the ground.

First was a permit pulled for the work and most importantly second, without owning the property can they legally charge people to park there.

<p><em>2018-11-19 - 02284</em><br />There is a grey Nissan Versa, license plate 62200FF, that has consistently been parking in Resident Only Parking in this stretch of Beach Street for the last month. They are not a resident. The car has been ticketed 3-4 times in the last month, but not in a daily basis, so they are probably saving considerable money vs paid parking. But they are taking away Resident only parking from those of us who live in the neighborhood and pay high property <strong>taxes</strong> to do so.</p>

<p><em>2018-10-19 - 02116</em><br />People ripped through the trash bags this morning. Is it not the responsibility of the city to either prevent this from happening by ticketing trash pickers or to enable trash collection to sweep up debris?

I pay my <strong>taxes</strong> just like every other homeowner in Boston, I am not understanding why this is being denied. Please forward me a number of someone that I can talk to.</p>

I have called 911 without success ! No one has come. What else is a good citizen to do if these people interfere with my peace!

Lack of Aborists in Boston Proper | Comments on the Policy or Program: Constituent believes the fact that it takes six months to a year for tree maintenance requests to be filled is an unacceptable amount of time. She believes if the issue is a lack of arborists or people who can handle the job, then it is the responsibility of the city to hire more arborists who are able to deal with the city's extensive tree issue. If this means the city must raise <strong>taxes</strong>, that is what it is. She believes that a basic service that people expect from their city is not being filled in a reasonable time.</p>

<p><em>2018-08-31 - 02113</em><br />I just downloaded the :311 app because I'm very concerned with what has become of rose kennedy greenway by Hanover. To my shock and dismay it appears that this part of the beloved greenway is effectively a homeless encampment now. I have lived a block from here for over a decade and I bring my children here in the summer to play in the water. I won't anymore because the other day we went here and to our sadness during the day, the water fountains had been taken over.In addition to the crazy amounts of rats that now roam this ground, probably in part because of all the trash and food left. it appears that the drug addicts and homeless have become a mainstay of this once treasure in the city. It is such a disappointing thing to see... I would happily pay more in <strong>taxes</strong> to provide shelter to these individuals, but the situation has really gotten out of control. Are you even allowed to sleep in the greenway? Thanks. Next time I'll take a picture to highlight the scope of the issue</p>

<p><em>2018-08-13 - 02131</em><br />Type of request: Sign | Details: I have property at 390 Poplar St, Roslindale. I have lived there for several years. The speed at which traffic travels is excessive. I have issues pulling in and out of my driveway. Drivers express impatience and annoyance while I try to enter or leave my driveway. I feel that if a speed limit sign or blind driveway sign is posted this may help them slow down. Visitors have experienced this as well. yesterday I was almost hit on the passanger side as a truck sped down the hill. I have called the city many years ago with a complaint. A police car sitting in plain view only makes drivers slow down. perhaps a unmarked car or some sort of sign posted will make drivers slow down. I don't feel that I should get harassed for pulling out of a driveway that I pay property <strong>taxes</strong> on. Please post a sign at 388-390 Poplar Street. thank you caller called back, has gotten no response to case. caller called again 4/25 still has no response</p>
<p><em>2018-08-10 - 02119</em><br />We have had yard waste since Sunday evening, for pickup on Monday of this past week. That is the date posted.

This is becoming an eyesore and really not fair to be sitting here all week. This should be picked up immediately.</p>

I never wrote in but today i had enough i called the parking ticket number to get clarification of why i received a ticket in a spot where i paid for a meter and in 4 minutes was turning 8 pm which there is no time restriction. He was extremely rude not sure if he was was not in the mood to come in. When he answered he didn't say good morning which i should have known. I asked him can you please check on a ticket that was issued I'm just not sure why someone would issue the ticket, as well that person had to be waiting to give me that ticket because honestly, no one is still on foot at 7:56 p.m. He said the ticket is correct you have to move your car from that block after two hours. I stated sir I understand but its free parking after 8 p.m he stated we can care less if its a minute you'll get a ticket. I told him that is a bit ridiculous. he stated if you don't like the rules do not park in Boston or talk to the mayor. I stated ok sir you must be having a bad morning can i speak with a supervisor. He told me to call the mayor and hung up the phone on me. So I am writing the email just for that because he refused to transfer me to a supervisor as requested and told me to contact the mayor. This may seem like not a big issue but i pay <strong>taxes</strong> to the city of Boston and a resident. I work for a company that does a lot of work for the city of Boston. I should not have to deal with rude employees their needs to be a level of respect. City workers some have the attitude they have the power of the people and they can do anything they want. I am sure you guys have an HR office, as well an employee handbook that should have a section on how to treat the people who call and I'm sure it does not say it's okay to be rude. I know this email does not go directly to the Mayor himself but i would like it to be known that the city employees need to change their attitudes on how they treat people. Same for individuals in the DMV employees. The tone of your voice and the words you use makes a huge difference.</p>

<p><em>2019-05-15 - 02128</em><br />Case (SR) Type: Assessing | Referred To: TAX: COLLECTING | Description: Constituent reports that 3 years ago, he made an over-payment for property tax (total overpayment of $2,273.78). Constituent states he has been going back and forth with the City since then because of this. Constituent reports that the City's appeal board sided with the constituent, saying that the City owed him money. Constituent states that he only received a small portion of what he is owed ($312.22). Constituent requests a follow regarding this, and requests that he receives all the money he is owed ($1,961.56). This is an ongoing issue and the constituent is still left without the rest of the payment, and with unanswered requests for help. Please get in contact with the constituent to set up a meeting to get to the bottom of this and to see if he can get back the overpay from his property <strong>taxes</strong> sent to the city. He says he has a court order saying that the City of Boston owes him the money.</p>

<p><em>2019-05-03 - 02118</em><br />Type of improvement: Landscaping | Affiliation type: Constituent | Additional info: Last year at this time I suggested re-seeding Blackstone Park, but nothing was done. What it REALLY needs, are drains in the center of each of the 4 quadrants, but that is a larger project. When we get more than a short shower, the center of each quadrant floods, a pond develops, and the grass dies, and when it dries out, it becomes a dust bowl. Re-seeding isn't all that expensive. Since the park gets heavy use from dog walkers and sun bathers, it would be good to loosen the soil with a lawn aeration roller behind a tractor or hand aeration roller, so the new seeds can have a chance to sprout. I would suggest doing HALF the park at a time, with it then being taped off with yellow flags to ask people to stay off for a while while the new grass germinates. Then the second half could follow in a similar fashion. I have a photo of the park in its present condition that I could send if you like. Let me know. If there were a place to attach it here, I would. We neighbors pay hefty <strong>taxes</strong>, and deserve a little more attention to the common parks nearby. Concerned neighbor.</p>

When I was a kid I could go from Medford Street all the way up to 24 Mystic Street. Now I can't even go past 52 Mystic . This is where the first fence starts. Not only did they block this access but they block the access from Mystic Street also. It is also blocked at 38 and 24 Mystic also. The part that bothers me the most is that they come and just put up gates in a PUBLIC ALLEYWAY and block off the PUBLIC but they also get to make their YARDS about 200 square feet bigger. ( That you are losing out on Taxes) . Don't you think I would of loved to make my yard a little bigger also but the PEOPLE THAT HAVE LIVED HERE ABOUT 40years longer than any of these people.But even if I wanted to I couldn't because I am at the beginning and it couldn't be done</p>
<p><em>2019-04-23 - 02201</em><br />I am opposed to charging residents for resident permit parking stickers.  Homeowners and renters are already paying substantial property <strong>taxes</strong> and our <strong>taxes</strong> should cover those types of fees.  I believe charging for resident parking will also negatively impact the elderly on fixed incomes and low income families.  The city needs to come up with better ways to address the resident parking issue.  First, the city should not be allowing short-term rentals and sober houses to apply for resident parking.  These types of residences are short-term in nature and should not be afforded resident parking. Second, the city needs to limit the number of resident parking stickers per property.  There are some properties in the city that have 8-10+ parking stickers.  Resident parking is a city resource and it should be better managed.  However I am against charging for stickers as it is not viable solution.</p>

Concerns about mail delivery to Collectors Office | Comments on the Policy or Program: constituent sent email to Boston.gov Contact Form stating, "Dear Mr. Mayor, I am beginning to have great concern that the Office of the Collector is not able to process payments in a timely fashion, or that your mail office isn't able to direct incoming mail in a timely fashion. I pay my Real Estate Taxes via Bill Pay with Bank of America and have been doing so for over a decade without issue. I have always set the payment date to be the due date, and I assume the City receives that check and processes the payment on that date, since I have never received and interest fees for late payment. However, I have had two incidents since July 2019 that lead me to believe that something in the City's logistics chain (either mail or Collector processing) has changed. I had set my July 2019 real estate tax payment to be paid on July 31, 2019. Bank of America sends that check out so it is received by July 31. My check was not posted by the Collector until August 9. This resulted in $4.43 in interest fees. In a second episode, I had set my January 2020 real estate tax payment to be paid on January 30, 2020. As of today, February 28, this check has not been posted by the Collector. I have been assessed $5 in fees and $23.33 in interest. Given that I have gone over a decade paying my real estate <strong>taxes</strong> quarterly in this fashion, I am only left to believe that either a) the Collector is not processing payments in a timely fashion, b) mail is not being sorted and delivered to departments in a timely fashion, or c) both.

<p><em>2020-01-15 - 02125</em><br />Black Ford Taurus parked on Bakersfield and sometimes Trescott St with out of state plates GKE4896 expired plate 2018 in the neighborhood since summer time.  Owner lives at 63 Bakersfield st.  Needs to be ticketed bc after living in Massachusetts over 30 days your vehicle needs to be registered in Massachusetts.  Owner of the vehicle has his name on a engraved plack onto the house.  Needs to pay Massachusetts excise <strong>taxes</strong> on his car.  This isn't the first time I've reported this vehicle.</p>
<p><em>2020-01-14 - 02118</em><br />I called the Mayor's 311 Hotline around 2:00-2:30pm on 1/14/2020 to report that the trash collectors had skipped our house, #52 Union Park, and #48 Union Park. At 5:30pm I called again to report that trash was still outside #52, #48, #12 or #14, #3 Union Park, and probably a few other houses on Union Park. Our trash was outside 52 Union Park at 8:00pm on 1/13/2020 - LAST NIGHT! Why wasn't our trash collected along with the rest of our street today? I was told by the 311 operator at 5:30pm I would have to call back after 6:00pm - just 30 minutes away. However, at 6:00pm I was in the middle of preparing dinner. Please DO NOT TICKET OUR BUILDING for having trash out on the wrong day. I pay my real estate <strong>taxes</strong> well in advance of the due date. Why won't City Hall pay attention to my phone request to have sanitation come back to our street to pick up the trash they skipped, or missed. There's no snow on the ground. What can Mayor Walsh do to rectify this problem?</p>
<p><em>2020-01-08 - 02127</em><br />This New Hampshire plate has been in this spot for 4 days and not 1 ticket but I have to park blocks away even though I have a resident sticker and pay property <strong>taxes</strong></p>

<p><em>2020-01-01 - 02109</em><br />30x30 area with a tone of potholes. Road is too deteriorated to refill holes. Must grind and resurface. You've filled this area many times. Stop using ineffective temporary patches and fix it correctly. We pay our <strong>taxes</strong> so fix it properly for once.</p>
<p><em>2019-12-31 - 01125</em><br />There is a massive pothole which I've now gotten two flat tires in the last month. Please fix this pothole and others on this road as it's a large hazard. We pay good <strong>taxes</strong> to keep the roads in drivable condition and this has cost me a lot of personal money to have multiple tires fixed in such short period of time.</p>
<p><em>2019-12-20 - 02128</em><br />Why can't public works pick up this trash it will be there until Monday, is this why we pay <strong>taxes</strong>?</p>

Says there should at least be a grace period for making the appropriate registration changes.</p>
<p><em>2019-11-30 - 01125</em><br />Fix this! The trash, the loitering. What a mess. How long would residents of beacon hill put up with this? We can do better! This makes me ashamed. Tell Walsh we pay lots of <strong>taxes</strong> and we vote!</p>
<p><em>2019-11-26 - 02120</em><br />Why are there so few handicapped spots in this area? I work near here (and thus, pay <strong>taxes</strong>!), and I am disabled. I think I've counted 2 handicapped spots in a roughly 1/4 mile radius of this address.Is there any City agency where one can make requests for such things? I just realized tonight that SeeClickFix might be able to route this to the correct agency![submitted via https://seeclickfix.com/issues/7026435]</p>
<p><em>2019-11-26 - 02126</em><br />Pls tow this car in front of my driveway I pay my <strong>taxes</strong> this shouldn't be happening all the time over here this car been here for a month</p>

<p><em>2019-11-05 - 02109</em><br />We pay a lot of <strong>taxes</strong> and money to live here. We have to suffer the screaming outside our homes and their trash too?? What a horrible place to live right now.[submitted via https://seeclickfix.com/issues/6934254]</p>
<p><em>2019-11-05 - 02125</em><br />Again the Ford Taurus all day yesterday and overnight parking.  The issue is he lives on this street with out of state plates!  I thought we were cracking down on this.  I have to pay my excise <strong>taxes</strong> and he doesn't!  Taking up parking that's limited.  I will keep posting until this is corrected.  He lives in mass w his name on the building but can't change his plates?! Not fair to others.</p>
<p><em>2019-10-30 - 02125</em><br />This vehicle is a Ford taurus parked over night with out of state plate. The owner lives across the street and has there name on the doorbell.  If u can have your name on your doorbell why is that ok to park in a limited area with a out of state plate.  Please do something we all have to pay excise <strong>taxes</strong> t</p>
<p><em>2019-10-22 - 02132</em><br />Small amount of home repair debris split into two barrels that weight 35/40 a piece and the trash guys don't take it!!?? What are we paying <strong>taxes</strong> for? I'm not a contractor, I work for the City of Boston myself. I have never put anything out for trash that they shouldn't pick up. Please send a Public Works truck yo get these two barrels.</p>
<p><em>2019-10-17 - 02129</em><br />Please send parking enforcement to Charlestown on the nights of bruins home games.   People park here in droves rather than pay for a garage in north station.  They do it because they know that no one from the city is going to give them a ticket meanwhile when residents with actual Parking permits come home from work all the spots are taken and we have to pay for the garage space.   This really only happens with bruins fans for some reason.   DO YOUR JOB!!  We pay <strong>taxes</strong> and deserve the street parking more than someone coming in from the suburbs who are too cheap to pay for the parking.</p>
<p><em>2019-10-15 - 02119</em><br />Trash can has been overflowing since last week y'all said u changed it but never did can someone please do there job I pay <strong>taxes</strong> for a reason</p>
<p><em>2019-10-02 - 02115</em><br />The sidewalk work finished weeks ago. All the sidewalks on the contiguous blocks are filled in.  This is what they did today. Totally not helpful for wheelchair or stroller. Don't respond that they are working on it. All the other gaps are filled. This is irresponsible and why do we pay property <strong>taxes</strong>??? Make your contractors do their job</p>
<p><em>2019-09-26 - 02119</em><br />I live on 77 Windsor St, and this is what is currently happening across from my house. Daily drug and drink usage, littering, urinating in public, and now  camping. I understand that there is a drug crisis going on, and I completely understand that drug addicts need help, and I gladly pay <strong>taxes</strong> for that.That does not mean I want to see people injecting, drinking, littering, and camping in front of my residence.I want to feel safe! Please, help us here.Thank you!</p>

Got no response to last weeks complaint. Seems to me I pay <strong>taxes</strong> and this is one of the services the city is to provide on a WEEKLY basis.</p>
<p><em>2019-08-08 - 01210</em><br />ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!! The City of Boston and the DCR need to stop ignoring this park!

Pick up the glass from broken bottles in the playground! This is not acceptable, Not one other park or playground looks like this in the city or state!!!!</p>

<p><em>2020-06-17 - 02113</em><br />I am all for a phased reopening of the NE restaurants, but out of towners are coming here in droves now it basically looks like a feast is going on every night. We've all done our part the past 3 months to keep the community safe and now have to deal with over clogged sidewalks, tables less than 6 ft apart etc... Also, what is being done for the complete lack of parking parking for residents who pay <strong>taxes</strong> to park here, not to mention delivery drivers and emergency vehicles? No notice was given.</p>
<p><em>2020-06-16 - 02212</em><br />The City has abandoned us. Stop paying your property <strong>taxes</strong>. Maybe that will change something.</p>

<p><em>2020-06-10 - 02126</em><br />Over three weeks ago I reported that this sign had been installed incorrectly. The sign is upside down.

Please reinstall the sign as a good faith measure to a predominantly minority neighborhood. At least feign care and concern.</p>

I want an explanation why this car hasn't been tagged. This is ridiculous! We have resident stickers and obey the rules and hope we can park on our own street but with disrespectful people and unhelpful city employees we have to suffer.

Stop using covid as an excuse</p>

<p><em>2020-04-01 - 02128</em><br />You keep closing these out without doing anything. You said signs end at 6. The car was there all day yesterday and just moved at 3pm today. Going to say that is over the two hours posted. Now it is back and will be fine for another day. As I get my excise tax, should I not pay it?  Why pay it if you can just go to NH pay their <strong>taxes</strong> and take up spots here.  We should be ticketing for people taking spots that residents have stickers for and deserve.</p>
<p><em>2020-04-01 - 02201</em><br />Think it's time to replace all the signs that were changed to Resident parking only from 6:00pm-8:00am back two two hour parking except Resident All week in East Boston.Way to many cars with no stickers are here and not moving for days on end. Many sit for days without being ticketed. Not fair to the people who actually live and pay <strong>taxes</strong> here to not have anywhere to park.</p>
<p><em>2020-03-26 - 02128</em><br />My neighbors are myself I so tired of these people parking  this guy covers his car so he doesn't get a ticket.. we all pay our <strong>taxes</strong> who knows what's in that car.. this issue needs to be resolved.. this is on the corner of Gove and Frankfort Street</p>
<p><em>2020-03-26 - 02119</em><br />reported this out of state vehicle from Maryland parking on this street for the past year to "I pay-tax Program " Please reinforce the program so this people keeps evading <strong>taxes</strong>.</p>
<p><em>2020-03-25 - 02128</em><br />There is residential trash out 24/7 in shopping carts chained to a streetlight. I put the claim and the city's response is that those carts are personal property. This is illegal, just as a car parked on the curbside, or a bag of trash left on the street.This personal property is illegally in the street and is a hazard for the citizens of the neighborhood. What I am reading on the response from the city is that East Boston neighbors are 2nd-class citizens. I never saw anything like this in Beacon Hill or Back Bay. Don't we pay our <strong>taxes</strong> like anyone else in Boston? If the neighborhood is good enough for gentrification, it should be good enough to keep it clean. I can't imagine the city would allow having this in front of a restaurant in the north end, right? So why does it has to be in front of my home?Please, break the chain and take it out. Last summer I had to spend it smelling that trash from my place and looking at rats playing around. There are people living here, kids...</p>
<p><em>2020-03-20 - 02128</em><br />There is a NH plate that has been here for two days. Was across the street two days beforehand. Basically lives here in Eastie and doesn't have to pay <strong>taxes</strong>. But guess what, gets free parking. The city needs the money, so start ticketing. Unreal that all these spots are taken up and the city just lets it happen. Pretty sure parking enforcement isn't working from home.....or maybe they are. Parking around here is tough enough. Let's step up our game folks.</p>
